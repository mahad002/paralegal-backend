Property placed in a house, whether its door is closed or not, or in an almirah \nor a box or other container or in the custody of a person, whether he is paid for such custody or not is \nsaid to be in hirz. \n \n1 This Ordinance has been appl ied to the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas of Baluchistan, by Baluchistan Govt. Notification No. S.O. (TA) -3 \n(46)/79, dated 29 -4-1979, see Baluchistan Gazette, 1979, Ext. (Issue No. 58, dated 14 -6-1979).  \nThis Ordinance has been applied to the Federa lly Administered Tribal Areas, by S.R.O. No. 362 (l)/79, dated 23 -4-1979, see Gaz. of P., 4979, Ext., Pt. \nII, p. 632.  \nThis Ordinance has also been applied to the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas of the N.W.F.P. by Notification No. 127 -HD (T.A. HI)/79 -H, dated \nthe 26th May, 1979, see Gaz. of N.W.F.P. Ext. 1979, p. 1101.  \n \nPage 4 of 10 \n Explanation 2.  If a single family is living in a house, the entire house will constitute a single \nhirz, but if two or more families are living in one house severally, the portion in the  occupation of \neach family will constitute separate hirz. \n(e) “Imprisonment for life” means imprisonment till death;  \n(f) “ nisab  “ means the ‘ nisab ’ as laid down in section 6;  \n(g) “tazir” means any punishment other than hadd; and all other terms and \nexpres sions not defined in this Ordinance shall have the same meaning as in \nthe Pakistan Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860), or the Code of Criminal \nProcedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898).  \n3. Ordinance to override other laws . The provisions of this Ordinance shall have effec t \nnotwithstanding  anything contained in any other for the time being in force.  \n4. Two kinds of theft.  Theft may be either theft liable to hadd  or theft liable to tazir. \n5. Theft liable to hadd . Whoever, being an adult, surreptitiously commits, from any hirz, \ntheft of property of the value of the nisab or more not being stolen property, knowing that it is or is \nlikely to be of the value of the nisab  or more is, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, said to \ncommit theft liable to hadd . \nExplanation 1 . In this section “stolen property” does not include property which has been \ncriminally misappropriated or in respect of which criminal breach of trust has been committed.  \nExplanation 2 . In this section, “surreptitiously” means that the person committing the theft \ncommits such theft believing that the victim of theft does not know of his action. For surreptitious \nremoval of property it is necessary that, if it is day -time, which includes one hour before sunrise and \ntwo hours after sunset, surreption should con tinue till the completion of the offence and, if it is night, \nsubreption need not continue after commencement of the offence.  \n6. Nisab — The nisab  for theft liable to hadd  is four decimal four five seven (4.457) grams of \ngold, or other property of equivalen t value, at the time of theft.  \nExplanation. — If theft is committed from the same hirz in more than one transaction, or from \nmore than one hirz and the value of the stolen property in each case is less than the nisab , it is not \ntheft liable to hadd  even if the value of the property involved in all cases adds up to , or exceeds, the \nnisab . \nIllustrations  \n(a) A enters a house occupied by a single family and removes from various rooms \nproperty the value of which adds up to, or exceed the nisab . Such theft is \nliable to hadd  even though the value of the property removed from any of the \nrooms does not amount to the nisab . If the house is occupied by more than one \nfamily and the value of the property removed from the hirz of any one family \nis less than the nisab , then  the theft is not liable to hadd  even though the value \nof the properties removed adds up to, or exceeds, the nisab . \n(b) A enters a house several times and removes from the house on each occasion \nproperty the value of which does not amount to the nisab . Suc h theft is not \n \nPage 5 of 10 \n liable to hadd  even though the value or the properties removed adds up to, or \nexceeds, the nisab . \n7. Proof of theft liable to hadd . The proof of theft liable to hadd  shall be in one of the \nfollowing forms namely:  \n(a) the accused pleads guilt y of the commission of theft liable to hadd ; and  \n(b) at least two Muslim adult male witnesses, other than the victim of the theft, \nabout whom the Court is satisfied, having regard to the requirements of \ntazkiyah -al-shuhood , that they are truthful persons a nd abstain from major sins \n(kabair ), give evidence as eye -witnesses of the occurrence:  \nProvided that, if the accused is a non -Muslim, the eye -witnesses may be non -Muslim:  \nProvided further that the statement of the victim of theft or the person authorised b y him shall \nbe recorded before the statements of the eye -witnesses are recorded.  \nExplanation. —In this section, tazkiyah -al-shuhood means the mode of inquiry adopted by a \nCourt to satisfy itself as to the credibility of a witness.  \n8. Commission of theft li able to hadd  by more than one person.  Where theft liable to hadd  \nis committed by more than one person and the aggregate value of the stolen property is such that, if \nthe property is divided equally amongst such of them as have entered the hirz each one of them gets \na share which amounts to, or exceeds the nisab  the hadd  shall be imposed on all of them who have \nentered the Hirz, whether or not each one of them has moved the stolen property of any part thereof.  \n9. Punishment of theft liable to hadd .—(1) Whoev er commits theft liable to hadd  for the \nfirst time shall be punished with amputation of his right hand from the joint of the wrist.  \n(2) Whoever commits theft liable to hadd  for the second time shall be punished with \namputation of his left foot up to the an kle. \n(3) Whoever commits theft liable to hadd  for the third time, or any time subsequent thereto, \nshall be punished with imprisonment for life.  \n(4) Punishment under sub -section (1) or sub -section (2) shall not be executed unless it is \nconfirmed by the Cour t to which an appeal from the order of conviction lies, and until the \npunishment is confirmed and executed the convict shall be dealt with in the same manner as if \nsentenced to simple imprisonment.  \n(5) In the case of a person sentenced to imprisonment for life under sub -section (3), if the \n1[Appellate Court] is satisfied that he is sincerely  penitent, he may be set at liberty on such terms and \nconditions as the Court may deem fit to impose.  \n(6) Amputation shall be carried out by an authorised medical office r. \n(7) If, at the time of the execution of hadd  the authorised medical officer is of the opinion that  \nthe amputation of hand or foot may cause the death of the convict, the execution of hadd  shall be \npostponed until such time as the apprehension of death cases.  \n \n1 Subs, by the Offences Against Property (Enforcement of Hudood) (Amdt.)
