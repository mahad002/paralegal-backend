Exclusion  of provisions  of Ordinance  void;  an offence. Where  any provision  in a \ncontract  of insurance  has the effect  of modifying  or excluding,  to the prejudice  of any person  other  \nthan the insurer,  any applicable  provision  of this Ordinance,  any such provision  shall  be void and the \ninsurer  shall  be liable to punishment  for an offence  under  this Ordinance.  \n79. Remedies  for non-disclosure  or misre presentation. —(1) This section  shall  apply  where  \nthe person  who became  the policy  holder  under  a contract  of insurance  upon  the contract  being  \nentered  into: \n \nPage 67 of 109 \n (a)  failed  to comply  with the duty of disclosure;  or \n(b)  made  a misrepresentation  to the insurer  before  the contract  was entered  into. \n(2) The insurer  may not avoid  a contract  of insurance  by reason  only of the failure  to comply  \nwith the duty of disclosure  or the misrepresentation  if: \n(a)  the insurer  would  have  entered  into the contract,  for the same  premium  and on \nthe same  terms  and conditions,  even  if the insured  had not failed  to comply  \nwith the duty of disclosure  or had not made  the misrepresentation  before the \ncontract  was entered  into; or \n(b)  the failure  to comply  with the duty of disclosure  or the misrepresentation  was \nnot fraudulent:  \nProvided  that in circumstances  to which  clause  (b) refers,  the insurer  shall  be entitled  to be \nplaced,  in such manner,  not otherwise  inconsistent  with this subsection,  as may be prescribed,  in a \nposition  in which  the insurer  would  have  been  if the failure  had not occurred  or the misrepresentation  \nhad not been  made.  \n(3) Subject  to sub-section  (2), if the failure  was fraudu lent or the misrepresentation  was made  \nfraudulently,  the insurer  may avoid  the contract.  \n(4) Nothing  in this section  shall  affect  any right  of an insurer  to recover  damages  from  any \nperson  in respect  of loss suffered  by the insurer  as a result  of a fraudul ent act by that person,  or any \ncriminal  liability  to which  any person  may be subject  by reason  of a fraudulent  act by that person.  \n80. Policy  not to be called  in question  on ground  of mis-statement  after  two years.  \nNotwithstanding  anything  is section  79, no policy  of life insurance  effected  before  the \ncommencement  date of this Ordinance  shall  after the expiry  of two years  from  the commencement  \ndate of this Ordinance  and no policy  of life insurance  effected  after the commencement  date shall,  \nafter the expiry  of two years  from  the date on which  it was effected,  be called  in question  by an \ninsurer  on the ground  that a statement  made  in the proposal  for insurance  or in any report  of a \nmedical  officer,  or referee,  or friend  of the policy  holder,  or in any other  document  leading  to the \nissue  of the policy,  was inaccurate  or false,  unless  the insurer  shows  that such statement  was on a \nmaterial  matter  or suppressed  facts  which  it was material  to disclose  and that it was fraudulently  \nmade  by the policy  holder  and that the policy  holder  knew  at the time of making  it that the statement  \nwas false  or that it suppressed  facts  which  it was material  to disclose:  \nProvided  that nothing  in this section  shall  prevent  the insurer  from  calling  for proof  of age at \nany time if he is entitled  to do so, and no policy  shall  be deemed  to be called  in question  merely  \nbecause  the benefits  payable  under  the policy  are adjusted  on subsequent  proof  that the age of the life \ninsured  was incorrectly  stated  in the proposal.  \n81. Tribunal  may disreg ard avoidance  in certain  circumstances. —(1) In any proceedings  \nby the policy  holder  a respect  of a contract  of insurance  that has been  avoided  on the ground  of \nfraudulent  failure  to comply  with the duty of disclosure  or fraudulent  misrepresentation,  the Tribunal  \nmay,  if it would  be harsh  and unfair  not to do so, but subject  to this section,  disregard  the avoidance  \nand, if it does so, shall  allow  the policy  holder  to recover  the whole,  or such part as the Tribunal  \n \nPage 68 of 109 \n thinks  just and equitable  in the circumstanc es, of the amount  that would  have  been  payable  if the \ncontract  had not been  avoided.  \n(2) The power  conferred  by sub-section  (1) may be exercised  only where  the Tribunal  is of \nthe opinion  that, in respect  of the loss that is the subject  of the proceedings  before  the Tribunal,  the \ninsurer  has not been  prejudiced  by the failure  or misrepresentation  or, if the insurer  has been  so \nprejudiced,  the prejudice  is minimal  or insignificant.  \n(3) In exercising  the power  conferred  by sub-section  (1), the Tribunal:  \n(a)  shall have  regard  to the need  to deter  fraudulent  conduct  in relation  to \ninsurance;  and \n(b)  shall  weigh  the extent  of the culpability  of the policy  holder  in the fraudulent  \nconduct  against  the magnitude  of the loss that would  be suffered  by the policy  \nholder if the avoidance  were  not disregarded,  but may also have  regard  to any \nother  relevant  matter.  \n(4) The power  conferred  by sub-section  (1) applies  only in relation  to the loss that is the \nsubject  of the proceedings  before  the Tribunal,  and any disregard  by the Tribunal  of the avoidance  \ndoes not otherwise  operate  to reinstate  the contract.  \n82. Cancellation  of a life insurance  policy  for fraudulent  claim. —(1) Notwithstanding  \nanything  to the contrary  in this Ordinance,  a policy  of life insurance  may be cancel led in accordance  \nwith this section  by reason  that a person  having  or purporting  to have  rights  under  the policy  has \nmade  a claim  under  the policy  which  is fraudulent.  \n(2) A life insurer  may apply  to the Tribunal  for consent  to cancel  a policy  of life insurance  in \naccordance  with this section.  \n(3) The life insurer  shall  give written  notice  to the policy  holder  and to any person  identified  \nin the application  for consent  that an application  for consent  under  sub-section  (2) is to be made.  \n(4) Where  the Tribun al is satisfied  with respect  to the matters  contained  in sub-section  (1), \nthe Tribunal  shall  give its consent  and the insurer  may at any time thereafter  cancel  the policy  by \nwritten  notice  to the policy  holder.  \n(5) Where  a policy  is cancelled  under  this section,  the Tribunal  may on the application  of a \nperson  having  an interest  under  the policy  award  to any person  such amount  as is just and equitable  \nunder  the circumstances.  \n83.Power  of the Commission  to prescribe  rules  for market  conduct. —(1) The \nCommissio n may make  rules,  not inconsistent  with this Part, to govern  the conduct  of insurers,  \npolicy  holders  and intermediaries  in the insurance  market  in Pakistan.  \n(2) A provision  of a Rule  made  under  this section  which  applies  to a contract  of insurance  to \nwhich  it is relevant  and which  is entered  into after the commencement  date of that Rule  shall  be \ndeemed  to constitute  a condition  of that contract.  \n \nPage 69 of 109 \n 84.

Contractual  stipulations  for placing  insurance  with  specific  or named  insurers. —(1) \nIn respect  of any contract  or arrangement  under  which  one party  to the contract  or arrangement  \nrequires  another  party  to the contract  or arrangement  to procure,  effect  and pay for or reimburse  the \ncosts  of effecting  insurance  of any property,  liability,  life or anyth ing connected  with any thereof,  it \nshall  be unlawful  to stipulate,  expressly  or impliedly,  directly  or indirectly,  that the insurance  which  \nis to be procured  and effected  as a condition  of the contract  must  be placed  with any specific  or \nnamed  insurer  or insurers,  other  than insurers  specified  generally  as a class  according  to objective  \ncriteria  based  on financial  strength.  \n(2) Any such stipulation  in or arising  out of or connected  with any such contract  or \narrangement  made  after the commencement  date shall  be void and any such stipulation  in or arising  \nout of or connected  with any such contract  or arrangement  made  before  the commencement  of this \nOrdinance  shall  thereafter  be subject  to the provisions  of this section.  \n(3) If there  is any connection  or associ ation  between  a lender  and the insurer  it shall  be \ndisclosed  to the policy  holder  together  with any commissions  received  by the lender  from  the insurer  \nin respect  of the insurance  contract.
