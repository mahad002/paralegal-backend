Application  for construction  of new water -course.  Any person  desiring  the construction  \nof a new water -course  may apply  in writing  to the Divisional  Canal -officer,  stating — \n \n (1) that he has endeavoured  unsuccessfully  to acquire,  from  the owners  of the land through  \nwhich  he desires  such water -course  to pass,  a right  to occupy  so much  of the land as will be needed  \nfor such water -course  ; \n \n (2) that he desires  the said Canal -officer,  in his behalf  and at his cost, to do all things  \nnecessary  for acquiring  such right;  \n \n (3) that he is able to defray  all costs  involved  in acquiring  such right  and constructing  such \nwater -course.  \n \n 22. Procedure  of Canal -officer  thereupon. —If the Divisional  Canal -officer  considers — \n \n (1) that the construction  of such water -course  is expedient,  and \n \n (2) that the statements  in the application  are true, \n \n he shall  call upon  the applicant  to make  such deposit  as the Divisional  Canal -officer  considers  \nnecessary  to defray  the cost of the preliminary  proceedings,  and the amount  of any compensation  \nwhich  he considers  likely  to become  due under  section  28 ; \n \n and, upon  such deposit  being  made,  he shall  cause  enquiry  to be made into the most  suitable  \nalignment  for the said water -course, and shall  mark  out the land which,  in his opinion,  it will be \nnecessary  to occupy  for the construction  thereof,  and shall  forth with publish  a notice  in every  village  \nthrough  which  the water  -course  is proposed  to be taken,  that so much  of such land as belongs  to such \nvillage  has been  so marked  out, and shall  send a copy  of such notice  to the Collector  of every  district  \nin which  any part of such land is situate.  \n \n 23.

Any person  desiring  that an existing  \nwater -course  should  be transferred  from  its present  owner  to himself  may apply  in writing  to the \nDivisional  Canal -officer,  stating — \n \n (1) that he has endeavoured  unsuccessfully  to procure  such transfer  from  the owner  of such \nwater -course  ; \n \nPage 14 of 27 \n  (2) that he desires  the said Canal -officer,  in his behalf  and at his cost, to do all things  \nnecessary  for procuring  such transfer;  \n \n (3) that he is able to defray  the cost of such transfer.  \n \n Procedure  there upon.  If the Divisional  Canal -officer  considers — \n \n(a)  that the said transfer  is necessary  for the better  manage ment  of the irrigation  \nfrom  such water -course,  and \n \n(b) that the statements  in the application  are true, \n \n he shall  call upon  the applicant  to make  such deposit  as the Divisional  Canal -officer  considers  \nnecessary  to defray  the cost of the preliminary  proceedings,  and the amount  of any compensation  that \nmay become  due under  the provisions  of section  28 in respect of such transfer  ; \n \nand upon  such deposit  being  made,  he shall  publish  a notice  of the application  in every  village,  \nand shall  send a copy  of the notice  to the Collector  of every  district  through  which  such water -course  \npasses.  \n \n 24. Objections  to construction  or transfer  applied  for. Within thirty  days from  the \npublication  of a notice  under  section  22 or section  23, as the case may be, any person  interested  in the \nland or water -course  to which  the notice  refers  may apply  to the Collector  by petition,  stating  his \nobjection  to the construc tion or transfer  for which  application  has been  made.  \n  \n The Collector  may either  reject  the petition  or may proceed  to inquire  into the validity  of the \nobjection,  giving  previous  notice  to the Divisional  Canal -officer  of the place  and time at which  such \ninquiry  will be held.  \n \nThe Collector  shall  record  in writing  all orders  passed  by him under  this section  and the grounds  \nthereof.  \n \n 25. When  applicant  may be placed  in occupation.  If no such objection  is made,  or (where  \nsuch objection  is made)  if the Collec tor over-rules  it, he shall  give notice  to the Divisional  Canal -\nofficer  to that effect,  and shall  proceed  forthwith  to place  the said applicant  in occupation  of the land \nmarked  out or of the water -course  to be transferred,  as the case may be. \n \n 26. Procedu re when  objection  is held valid.  If the Collector  considers  any objection  made  as \nafore said to be valid  he shall  inform  the Divisional  Canal -officer  accor dingly  ; and, if such officer  \nsees fit, he may,  in the case of an appli cation  under  section  21, alter the boundaries  of the land so mar-\nked out, and may give fresh  notice  under  section  22; and the procedure  hereinbefore  provided  shall  be \napplicable  to such notice,  and the Collector  shall  thereupon  proceed  as before  provided.  \n \n 27. Procedure  when  Canal -officer  disagrees  with  Collector.  If the Canal -officer  disagrees  \nwith the Collector,  the matter  shall  be referred  for decision  to the 1Commissioner.  \n \nSuch  decision  shall  be final,  and the Collector,  if he is so directed  by such decision,  shall,  subject  to \nthe provisions  of section  28, cause  the said applicant  to be placed  in occupation  of the land so marked  \nout or of the water -course  to be transferred,  as the case may be. \n1In the N.W.F.P. for “Commissioner” read “Revenue Commissioner” see the N.W.F.P.

In determining  the compensation  to be made  under  \nsection  the Collector  shall  proceed  under  the provisions  of the 1[Land  Acquisition  Act, 1894  (1 of \n1894)]  ; but he may,  if the person  to be compensated  desire s, award  such compensation  in the form  of \na rent-charge  payable  in respect  of the land or water -course  occupied  or transferred.  \n \n Recovery  of compensation  and expenses.  If such compensation  and expenses  are not paid \nwhen  demanded  by the person  entitled  to receive  the same,  the amount  may be recovered  by the \nCollector  as if it were  an arrear  of land-revenue,  and shall,  when  recovered,  be paid by him to the \nperson  entitled  to receive  the same.  \n \n 29. Conditions binding on applicant placed in occupation. When a ny such applicant is \nplaced in occupation of land or of a water -course as aforesaid, the following rules and conditions shall \nbe binding on him and his representative in interest  : \n \n First.___ All works necessary for the passage across such water -course,  or water -courses, \nexisting previous to its construc tion and of the drainage intercepted by it, and for affording proper \ncommunications across it for the convenience of the neighboring lands, shall be constructed by the \napplicant, and be maintained by him  or his representative in interest to the satisfaction of  the \nDivisional Canal -officer.  \n \n Second.___ Land  occupied for a water -course under the provi sions of section 22 shall be used \nonly for the purpose of such water -course.  \n \n Third.___ The proposed wate r-course shall be completed to the satisfaction of the Divisional \nCanal -officer within one year after the applicant is placed in occupation of the land.  \n \n In cases in which land is occupied or a water -course is trans ferred on the terms of a rent -\ncharge.  \n \n Fourth.___ The applicant or his representative in interest shall, so long as he occupies such \nland or water -course, pay rent for the same at such rate and on such days as are deter mined by the \nCollector when the applicant is placed in occupation.  \n \n Fifth .___ If the right to occupy the land cease owing to a breach of any of these rules, the \nliability to pay the said rent shall continue until the applicant or his representative in interest has \nrestored the land to its original condition, or until he has pai d, by way of compensation for any injury \ndone to the said land, such amount and to such persons as the Collector determines.  \n \n Sixth.___ The Collector may, on the application of the person entitled to receive such rent or \ncompensation, determine the amount  of rent due or assess the amount of such compensa tion ; and, if \nany such rent or compensation be not paid by the applicant or his representative in interest, the \nCollector may recover the amount, with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent. per ann um from the \ndate on which it became due, as if it were an arrear of land -revenue, and shall pay the same, when \nrecovered, to the person to whom it is due.  \n \n1Subs.  by Ord.

The rates  to be charged  for canal -water  \nsupplied  for purposes  of irrigation  to the occupiers  of land shall  be determined  by the rulesl to be \nmade  by the 2[Provincial  Government],  and such occupiers  as accept  the water  shall  pay for it \naccordingly.  \n \n “Occupier’s  rate”.  A rate so charged  shall  be called  the “occupier’s  rate”.  \n \n 3[The  rules1 hereinbefore  referred  to may prescribe  and determine  what  persons  or classes  of \npersons  are to be deemed  to be occupiers  for the purposes  of this section,  and may also determine  the \nseveral  liabilities,  in respect  of the payment  of the occupier ’s rate, of tenants  and of persons  to whom  \ntenants  may have  sublet  their lands  or of proprietors  and of persons  to whom  proprietors  may have  let \nthe lands  held by them,  in cultivating  occupancy.]  \n \n 37. “Owner’s  rate”.  In addition  to the occupier’s  rate, a rate to be called  the “owner’s  rate”  \nmay be imposed,  according  to rules4 to be made  by the 2[Provincial  Government],  on the owners  of \ncanal  irrigated  lands,  in respect  of the benefit  which  they derive  from  such irriga tion. \n \n 38. Amount  of owner’s  rate.  The owner’s  rate shall  not exceed  the sum which,  under  the \nrules  for the time being in force  for the assessment  of land-revenue,  might  be assessed  on such land \non account  of the increase  in the annual  value  or produce  thereof  caused  by the canal -irrigation.  And,  \nfor the purpose  of this section  only,  land which  is permanent ly settled  or held free of revenue  shall  be \nconsidered  as though  it were  temporary  settled  and liable  to payment  of revenue.  \n \n 39. Owner’s  rate,  when  not chargeable.  No owner’s  rate shall  be chargeable  either  on the \nowner  or occupier  of land temporarily  assessed  to pay land-revenue  at irrigation -rates,  during  the \ncurrency  of such assessment.  \n \n 540. When  occupier  is to pay both  owner’s  rate and occupier’s  rate.  If such land is \noccupied  by the owner,  \n \nor if it is occupied  by a tenant  whose  rent is not liable  to enhancem ent on the ground  that the value  of \nthe produce  of the land or the productive  powers  of the land has or have  been  increa sed by irrigation,  \nsuch owner  or tenant  shall  pay the owner’s  rate as well as the occupier’s  rate. \n \n 541. Power  to make  rules  for appor tioning  owner’s  rate.  In the case of a tenant  with a right  \nof occupancy,  the 2[Provincial  Government]  shall  have  power  to make  rules  for dividing the owner’s  \nrate between  such tenant  and his landlord,  proportionately  to the extent  of the beneficial  intere st of \neach in the Land.  \n \n 542. When owner is to pay owner’s rate. If the owner of the land is not the occupier, but has \npower to enhance the rent of the occupier on the ground that the value of the produce or the \nproductive powers of the land has or have b een increased by irrigation  ; \n \n or if, when the amount of a rent was fixed, the land was irri gated from the canal,  \n       the owner shall pay the owner’s rate.  \n \n1For instance  of such notifications,  see Punjab  Gazette,  1903,  Pt.

Effect  of introduction  of canal  irrigation  on landlord’s  right  to enhance.  If a revision  \nof settlement  is a ground  for entertaining  a suit for the enhancement  of rent, the introduction  of canal  \nirriga tion into any land shall have  the same  effect  on the landlord’s  right  to re-enhance  the rent of a \ntenant  with a right  of occupancy  of such land,  as if a revision  of settlement  had taken  place,  under  \nwhich  the revenue  payable  in respect  of such land had been  increased.  \n \n 44. Wate r-rate by whom  payable  when  charged  on land  held by several  owners.  Where  a \nwater -rate is charged  on land held by several  joint owners,  it shall  be payable  by the manager  or other  \nperson  who receives  the rents  or profits  of such land,  and may be deducted  by him from  such rents  or \nprofits  before  division,  or may be recovered  by him from  the persons  liable  to such rate in the manner  \ncustom ary in the recovery  of other  charges  on such rents  or profits.  \n \nRecovery of charges  \n \n 45. Certified  dues  recoverable  as land-revenue.  Any sum lawfully  due under  this Part, and \ncertified  by the Divisional  Canal -officer  to be so due, which  remains  unpaid  after the day on which  it \nbecomes  due, shall  be recoverable  by the Collector  from  the person  liable  for the same  as if it were an \narrear  of land-revenue.  \n \n 46.
