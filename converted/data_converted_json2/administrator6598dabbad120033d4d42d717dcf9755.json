Pleading.  “Pleading ” shall mean plaint or written statement.  \n2. Pleading to state material facts and not evidence.  Every pleading shall contain, and \ncontain only, a statement in a concise form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for \nhis claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved, and \nshall, when neces sary, be divided into paragraphs, numbered consecutively. Dates, sums and numbers \nshall be expressed in figures.  \n3. Forms of pleading.  The forms in Appendix A when applicable, and where they are not \napplicable forms of the like character, as nearly as may be, shall be used for all pleadings.  \n4. Particulars to be given where necessary . In all cases in which the party pleading relies on \nany misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, willful default, or undue influence, and in all other cases \nin which particul ars may be necessary beyond such as are exemplified in the forms aforesaid \nparticulars (with dates and items if necessary) shall be stated in the pleading.  \n5. Further and better statement, or particulars.  A further and better statement of the nature \nof the  claim or defence, or further and better particulars of any matter stated in any pleading, may in \nall cases be ordered, upon such terms, as to costs and otherwise, as may be just.  \n6. Condition precedent.  Any condition precedent, the performance or occurren ce of which is \nintended to be contested, shall be distinctly specified in his pleading by the plaintiff or defendant, as \nthe case may be; and, subject thereto, an averment of the performance or occurrence of all conditions \nprecedent necessary for the case of the plaintiff or defendant shall be implied in his pleading.  \n \n   \n \nPage 70 of 318 \n 7. Departure.  No pleading shall, except by way of amendment, raise any new ground of claim \nor contain any allegation of fact inconsistent with the previous pleadings of the party pleading the \nsame.  \n8. Denial of contract.  Where a contract is alleged in any pleading, a bare denial of the same \nby the opposite party shall be construed only as a denial in fact of the express contract alleged or of \nthe matters of fact from which the same may be implied, and not as a denial of t he legality or \nsufficiency in law of such contract.  \n9. Effect of document to be stated.  Wherever the contents of any document are material, it \nshall be sufficient in any pleading to state the effect thereof as briefly as possible, without setting out \nthe w hole or any part thereof, unless the precise words of the document or any part thereof are material.  \n10. Malice, knowledge, etc.  Wherever it is material to allege malice, fraudulent intention, \nknowledge or other condition of the mind of any person, it shal l be sufficient to allege the same as a \nfact without setting out the circumstances from which the same is to be inferred.  \n11. Notice.  Wherever it is material to allege notice to any person of any fact, matter or thing, \nit shall be sufficient to allege such  notice as a fact, unless the form or the precise terms of such notice, \nor the circumstances from which such notice is to be inferred, are material.  \n12. Implied contract or relation.  Whenever any contract or any relation between any persons \nis to be implie d from a series of letters or conversations or otherwise from a number of circumstances, \nit shall be sufficient to allege such contract or relation as a fact, and to refer generally to such letters, \nconversations or circumstances without setting them out i n detail. And if in such case the person so \npleading desires to rely in the alternative upon more contracts or relations than one as to be implied \nfrom such circumstances, he may state the same in the alternative.  \n13. Presumptions of law.  Neither party nee d in any pleading allege any matter of fact which \nthe law presumes in his favour or as to which the burden of proof lies upon the other side unless the \nsame has first been specifically denied (e.g., consideration for a bill of exchange where the plaintiff \nsues only on the bill and not for the consideration as a substantive ground of claim).  \n14. Pleading to be signed.  Every pleading shall be signed by the party and his pleader (if any): \nProvided that where a party pleading is, by reason of absence or for other good cause, unable to sign    \nthe pleading, it may be signed by any person duly authorized by him to sign the same or to sue or \ndefend on his behalf.  \n15. Verification of pleadings.__ (1) Save as otherwise provided by any law for the  time  being \nin force, every pleading shall be verified 1[on oath or solemn affirmation] at the foot  by the  party or \nby  one of the  parties pleading or by some other person proved to the satisfaction of the Court to be \nacquainted with the facts of the case.  \n(2) The person verifying shall specify, by reference to the numbered paragraphs of the pleading, \nwhat he verifies of his own know ledge and what he verifies upon information received  and believed \nto be true.  \n(3) The verification shall be signed by the person making it and shall state the date on which \nand the place at which it was signed.  \n \n1Ins. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12  of 1972), s.2 and Sch.  \n   \n \nPage 71 of 318 \n 16. Striking out pleadings.  The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck \nout or amended any matter in any pleading which may be unnecessary or scandalous or which may \ntend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fai r trial of the suit.  \n17. Amendment  of pleadings.  The Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either \nparty to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such \namendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions i n \ncontroversy between the parties.  \n18. Failure to amend after order.  If a party who has obtained an order for leave to amend \ndoes not amend accordingly within the time limited for that purpose by the order, or if no time is \nthereby limited then within four teen days from the date of the order, he shall not be permitted to amend \nafter the expiration of such limited time as aforesaid or of such fourteen days, as the case may be, \nunless the time is extended by the Court.  \n_______  \nORDER VII  \nPLAINT  \n1.

And the same rule shall apply to any relief claimed by the defendant in his written statement.  \n8. Relief founded on separate grounds.

Written statement.  The defendant may, and, if so required by the Court, shall , at or before \nthe first hearing or within such time as the Court may permit, present a written statement of his defence \n[:]1 \n2[Provided that the period allowed for filing the written statement shall not ordinarily exceed  \n3[thirty] days.]  \n \n1Subs. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s.2 and Sch. for full­stop.  \n2Proviso added ibid. \n3Subs. by Act. XIV of 1994, S.11.  \n  \n   \n \nPage 76 of 318 \n  \n2. New facts must be specially pleaded.  The defendant must raise by his pleading all matters, \nwhich show the suit not to be maintainable, or that the transaction is either void or voidable in point of \nlaw, and all such grounds of defence as, if not raised, would be likely to take the opposite p arty by \nsurprise, or would raise issues of fact not arising out of the plaint, as, for instance, fraud, limitation, \nrelease, payment, performance, or facts showing illegality.  \n3. Denial to be specific.  It shall not be sufficient for a defendant in his writ ten statement to \ndeny generally the grounds alleged by the plaintiff, but the defendant must deal specifically with each \nallegation of fact of which he does not admit the truth, except damages.  \n4. Evasive denial.  Where a defendant denies an allegation of f act in the plaint, he must not do \nso evasively, but answer the point of substance. Thus, if it is alleged that he received a certain sum of \nmoney, it shall not be sufficient to deny that he received that particular amount, but he must deny that \nhe received  that sum or any part thereof, or else set out how much he received. And if an allegation is \nmade with diverse circumstances, it shall not be sufficient to deny it along with those circumstances.  \n5. Specific denial.  Every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied specifically or by \nnecessary implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the defendant, shall be taken to \nbe admitted except as against a person under disability:  \nProvided that the Court may in its discretion require any fact  so admitted to be proved otherwise \nthan by such admission.  \n6. Particular  of set­off to  be  given in written statement.__ (1) Where in a suit for the \nrecovery of  money the defendant claims to set­off against the  plaintiff's demand any ascertained sum \nof money  legally recoverable by him from the plaintiff, not  exceeding the  pecuniary limits  of the  \njurisdiction  of the Court, and both parties fill the same  character as they fill in the  plaintiff's suit, the  \ndefendant  may,  at the first hearing of the suit, but not afterwards unless permitted by the Court, \npresent a written statement containing the particulars of the debt sought to be set­off.  \n(2) Effect of Set­off.  The written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a cross­suit \nso as to enable the Court to pronounce a final judgement in respect both of the original claim and of \nthe set­off: but this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount decreed, of  any pleader in respect of the \ncosts payable to him under the decree.  \n(3) The rules relating to a written statement by a defendant apply to a written statement in \nanswer    to a claim of set­off.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A bequeaths Rs.2,000 to B and appoints C h is executor and residuary legatee. \nB dies and D takes out administration to B's effect. C pays Rs.1,000 as surety \nfor D: then D sues C for    the legacy. C cannot set­off the debt of Rs.1,000 \nagainst the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the same character  with respect to \nthe legacy as they fill with respect to the payment of the Rs.1,000.  \n(b) A dies intestate and in debt to B.C takes out administration to A's effects and B \nbuys part of the effects from C. In a suit for the purchase­ money by C against \nB, the latter cannot set­ off the debt against the price, for C fills two different \ncharacters, one as the vendor to B, in which he sues B, and the other as \nrepresentative to A.  \n   \n \nPage 77 of 318 \n (c) A sues B on a bill of exchange. B alleges that A has wrongfully neglected to \ninsure B ’s goods and is liable to him in compensation which he claims to set­off. \nThe amount not being ascertained cannot be set­off.  \n(d) A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs.500, B holds a judgment against A for \nRs.1,000. The two claims being both definit e pecuniary demands may be set­off.  \n(e) A sues B for compensation on account of trespass. B holds a promissory note \nfor Rs.1,000 from A and claims to set­off that amount against any sum that A \nmay recover in the suit.

Framing of issues.__ (1) Issues arise when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed \nby the one party and denied by the other.  \n(2) Material propositions are those propositions of law or fact which a plaintiff must allege in \norder to show a right to sue or a defendant must allege in order to constitute his defence.  \n(3) Each material proposition affirmed by one party and denied by the other shall form the \nsubject of a distinct issue.  \n(4) Issues are of two kinds: (a) issues o f fact, (b) issues of law.  \n(5) At the first hearing of the suit the Court shall, after reading the plaint and the written \nstatements if any, and after such examination of the parties as may appear necessary, ascertain upon \nwhat material propositions of fac t or of law the parties are at variance, and shall thereupon proceed to \nframe and record the issues on which the right decision of the case appears to depend.  \n   \n \nPage 89 of 318 \n (6) Nothing in this rule requires the Court to frame and record issues where the defendant at \nthe first hearing of the suit makes no defence.  \n2. Issue of law and fact.  Where issues both of law and of fact arise in the same suit, and the \nCourt is of opinion that the case or any part thereof may be disposed of on the issues of law only, it \nshall try tho se issues first, and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit, postpone the settlement of the issues \nof fact until after the issues of law have been determined.  \n3. Materials from which issues may be framed.  The Court may frame the issues from all or \nany of t he following materials__ \n(a) allegations made on oath by the parties, or by any persons present on their \nbehalf, or made by the pleaders of such parties;  \n(b) allegations made in the pleadings or in answers to interrogatories delivered in \nthe suit;  \n(c) the contents of documents produced by either party.  \n4. Court may examine witnesses or documents before framing issues.  Where the Court is \nof opinion that the issues cannot be correctly framed without the examination of some person not \nbefore   the Court or without the inspection of some document not produced in the suit, it may adjourn \nthe framing of the issues to a futur e day, and may (subject to any law for the time being in force) \ncompel the attendance of any person or the production of any document by the person in whose \npossession or power it is by summons or other process.  \n5. Power to amend, and strike out, issues.__ (1) The Court may at any time before passing a  \ndecree amend the issues or frame additional issues on such terms as it thinks fit,. and all such \namendments or additional issues as may be necessary for determining the matters in controversy \nbetween the part ies shall be so made or framed.  \n(2) The Court may also, at any time before passing a decree, strike out any issues that appear \nto it   to be wrongly framed or introduced.  \n6. Questions of fact or law may by agreement be stated in form of issues.  Where the p arties \nto a suit are agreed as to the question of fact or of law to be decided between them, they may state the \nsame in the form of an issue, and enter into an agreement in writing that, upon the finding of the Court  \nin the affirmative or the negative of s uch issue,__ \n(a) a sum of money specified in the agreement or to be ascertained by the Court, or \nin such manner as the Court may direct, shall be paid by one of the parties to \nthe other of them, or that one of them be declared entitled to some right or \nsubject to some liability specified in the agreement;  \n(b) some property specified in the agreement and in dispute in the suit shall be \ndelivered by one of the parties to the other of them, or as that other may direct; \nor \n(c) One or more of the parties shall d o or abstain from doing some particular act \nspecified in the agreement and relating to the matter in dispute.  \n  \n   \n \nPage 90 of 318 \n 7. Court, if satisfied that agreement was executed in good faith, may pronounce judgment.  \nWhere the Court is satisfied, after making such inquiry as it deems proper,__ \n(a) that the agreement was duly executed by the parties,  \n(b) that they have a substantial interest in the decision of such question as aforesaid, \nand \n(c) that the same is fit to  be tried and decided,  \nit shall proceed to record and try the issue and state its finding or decision thereon in the same \nmanner as if the issue had been framed by the Court;  \nAnd shall, upon the finding or decision on such issue, pronounce judgment accordi ng to the \nterms of the agreement; and, upon the judgment so pronounced, a decree shall follow.  \n________  \nORDER XV  \nDISPOSAL OF THE SUIT AT THE FIRST HEARING  \n1. Parties not at issue.  Where at the first hearing of a suit it appears that the parties are not at \nissue on any question of law or of fact, the Court may at once pronounce judgment.  \n2.

Parties at issue.__ (1) Where  the parties are at issue on some question of law or of fact, and  \nissues have been framed by the Court as hereinbefore provided, if the Court is satisfied that no further \nargument or evidence than the parties can at once adduce is required upon such of the  issues as may \nbe sufficient for the decision of the suit, and that no injustice will result from proceeding with the suit \nforthwith, the Court may proceed to determine such issues, and, if  the  finding thereon is sufficient  \nfor the decision, may pronoun ce judgment accordingly, whether the summons has been issued for the \nsettlement of issues only or for the final disposal of the suit:  \nProvided that, where the summons has been issued for the settlement of issues only, the parties \nor their pleaders are pres ent and none of them objects.  \n(2) Where the finding is not sufficient for the decision, the Court shall postpone the further \nhearing  of the suit, and shall fix a day for the production of such further evidence, or for such further \nargument  as the case requ ires. \n4. Failure to provide evidence.  Where the summons has been issued for the final disposal of \nthe suit and either party fails without sufficient cause to produce the evidence on which he relies, the     \nCourt may at once pronounce judgment, or may, if it thinks fit, after framing and recording issues \nadjourn the suit for the production of such evidence as may be necessary for its decision upon such \nissues.  \n_______  \n   \n \nPage 91 of 318 \n ORDER XVI  \nSUMMONING AND ATTENDANCE OF WITNESSES  \n1[1.

In determining the amount payable under this  rule, the Court may, in the case of \nany person summoned to give evidence as an expert, allow reasonable remuneration for the time \noccupied both in giving evidence and in performing any work of an expert character necessary for the \ncase.  \n(3) Scale of expen ses. Where the Court is subordinate to a High Court, regard shall be had, in \nfixing the scale of such expenses, to any rules made in that behalf.   \n3. Tender of expenses to witness.  The sum so paid into Court shall be tendered to the person \nsummoned, at the time of serving the summons, if it can be served personally.  \n4. Procedure  where  insufficient  sum paid in.__ (1) Where it appears to the Court or to such  \nofficer as it appoints in  this behalf that the sum paid into Court is not sufficient to cover such expenses  \nor reasonable remuneration, the Court may direct such further sum to be  paid to the  person summoned \nas appears to be necessary on that account, and, in case  of defaul t  in  payment, may order such sum \nto  be levied by attachment and sale of the moveable property of the party obtaining the summons ; or \nthe Court may discharge the person summoned, without requiring him to give evidence ; or may both \norder such levy and d ischarge such person as aforesaid.  \n(2) Expenses of witness detained more than one day .
