The Municipality of Karachi (hereinafter called the Municipality) agrees to sell and the Trustee of  \nthe Port of Karachi (hereinafter called the Trustees) agree to purchase at or for the price of Rs. (18.054 -5-0) \neighteen thousand and fifty -four and annas five only, to be paid as hereinafter mentioned, all that eight -inch water \nmain now laid an extending from  the Currie Reservoir to the Travellers' Bungalow at the junction of Preedy and \nBunder Roads and all the iron piping connections and all appurtenances to the said main belonging or appertaining \nthereto.  \n \n2.  The Trustees shall lay a six -inch main from the point where the said eight -inch main terminates, \njoining up one with the other, and carry such six -inch main along the Bunder Road as far as the Merewether Clock \nTower then across the road into the Port Trust Import Yard along the cart road in front of the  Platform Sheds \njoining the Bunder Road after passing the Custom House on its south side and along the Napier Mole Road to \nany such point or points at Keamari as the Trustees may now or at any time hereafter deem necessary or expedient.  \n \n3. The Trustees sh all be at liberty to open up all roads along which the said six -inch main is to be laid \nto such depth or width as may be reasonably necessary, provided always that any road or portion of road so opened \nup shall be closed and restored to its original condit ion as soon as the main has been laid and provided also that \nthe Trustees shall fence the road so opened and take all the necessary precautions to avoid injury etc., to passengers \nand vehicular traffic. The work of laying the main shall, when commenced, co ntinue without interruption until \ncompletion.  \n \n4.  The pipe shall wherever practicable, be laid at such a depth below the surface of the road that there \nshall be at least two feet of filling over every portion of the same.  \n \n5.  During the construction of t he main the Engineer of the Municipality shall at all times have access \nto the works for the purpose of satisfying the Municipality that the laying of the pipes is being satisfactory carried \nout. \n \n6.  The Trustees shall pay to the Municipality the said sum  of Rs. 18.054 -5-0 herein agreed to be paid \none the completion of the six -inch main and when the new 6 annas rate comes into force.  \n \n7. During the continuance of this agreement the whole of the said main from the Currie Reservoir to   \nKeamari shall be the exclusive property of the Trustees, and the Trustees shall maintain and keep the same in \nproper repair and do all renewals add other works necessary for the proper unkeep of the line in such a manner \nthat whenever, during the continuance of this agreement and under the terms thereof or when on the expiration of \n30 years the line is taken over by the Municipality it shall be in a thoroughly good and satisfactory condition to \nfulfil at that time the functions for which it was originally laid. The Port Trust i n fact agree to hand over the main \nin the same satisfactory conditions as the Municipality would reasonably be expected to have maintained had it \nbeen their own property. That in case of any dispute between the Municipality and the Port Trust as to the \nsatisfactory condition of the pipes at the time they are taken over by the Municipality, the dispute shall be referred  \nto the Commissioner in Sind for final decision.  \n \n \n1Schedule D was inserted by s. 31 of the Karachi Port Trust (Amendment) Act, 1902 (Bom.
