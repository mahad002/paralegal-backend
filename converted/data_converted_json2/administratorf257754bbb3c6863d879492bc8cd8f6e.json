(w.e.f.  18th August,  1913).  \nIt has also been  extended  to the Leased  Areas  of Balochistan,  see the Leased  Areas  (Laws)  Order,  1950  (G.G.O.  3 of 1950)  (w.e.f . 15th August,  1947)  ; \nand applied  in the Federated  Areas  of Balochistan,  see Gazette  of India,  15th August,  1937,  Pt. I, p. 1499.  \n2Subs.  by the Central  Laws  (Statute  Reform)  Ordinance,  1960  (21 of 960),  s. 3 and 2nd Sch. (w.e.f . 14th October,  1955),  for the original  para,  as \namended  by A. O., 1949,  Arts.  3 (2) and 4. (w.e.f . 28th March,  1949).  \n \n \n \nPage 6 of 35  (b) A is the legal,  medical,  or spiritual  adviser  of B. By availing  himself  of his \nsituation  as such adviser,  A gains  some  pecuniary  advantage  which  might  \notherwise  have  accrued  to B. A is a trustee,  for B, within  the meaning  of this \nAct, of such advantage.  \n(c) A, being  B’s banker,  discloses  for his own purpose  the state of B’s account.

A is \na trustee,  within  the meaning  of this Act, of the renewed  lease,  for those  \ninterested  in the original  lease.  \n(e) A, one of several  partners,  is employed  to purchase  goods  for the firm.  A, \nunknown  to his co­partners,  supplies  them,  at the market­price,  with goods  \npreviously  bought  by himself  when  the price  was lower,  and thus makes  a \nconsiderable  profit.  A is a trustee  for his co­ partners,  within  the meaning  of \nthis Act, of the profit  so made.  \n(f) A, the manager  of B’s indigo­factory,  becomes  agent  for C, a vendor  of \nindigo­seed,  and receives,  without  B’s assent,  commission  on the seed \npurchased  from  C for the factory.

Recovery of specific immoveable property. A person entitled to the possession of \nspecific immoveable property may recover it in the manner prescribed by the Code of Civil \nProcedure2. \n 39. Suit by person  dispossessed  of immoveable  property.  If any person  is dispossessed  \nwithout  his consent  of immovea ble property  otherwise  than in due course  of law, he or any person  \nclaiming  through  him may,  by suit 4* * * recover  possession  thereof,  notwithstanding  any other  title \nthat may be set up in such suit. \n \n \n \n \n \n1See now the Registration  Act, 1908  (16 of 1908).  \n2See now the Code  of Civil  Procedure,  1908  (Act 5 of 1908).  \n3But see as to tenancies  in the Punjab,  the Punjab  Tenancy  Act, 1887  (16 of 1887),  s. 51. \n4The words  “instituted  within  six months  from  the date of the dispossession”  rep. by the Repealing  and Amending  Act, 1891  (12 of 1891)  (w.e.f . 21st \nMarch,  1891).  \nPage 8 of 35  \n \n  Nothing  in this section  shall  bar any person  from  suing  to establish  his title to such property  \nand to recover  possession  thereof.  \n No suit under  this section  shall  be brought  against  1[the 2[Federal  Government]  or any \nProvincial  Government].  \n No appeal  shall  lie from  any order  or decree  passed  in any suit instituted  under  this section,  \nnor shall  any review  of any such order  or decree  be allowed.  \n(b) Possession  of Moveble  Property  \n 10. Recovery  of specific  moveable  property.  A person  entitled  to the possession  of specific  \nmoveable  property  may recover  the same  in the manner  prescribed  by the Code  of Civil  Procedure3. \n Explanation  1.__ A trustee  may sue under  this section  for the possession  of property  to the \nbeneficial  interest  in which  the person  for whom  he is trustee  is entitled.  \n Explanation  2.__ A special  or temporary  right  to the present  possession  of property  is \nsufficient  to support  a suit under  this section.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A bequeaths  land to B for his life, with remainder  to C. A dies. B enters  on the \nland,  but C, without  B’s consent,  obtains  possession  of the title deeds.  B may \nrecover  them  from  C. \n(b) A pledges  certain  Jewels  to B to secure  a loan.  B disposes  of them  before  he is \nentitled  to do so. A, without  having  paid or tendered  the amount  of the loan,  \nsues B for possession  of the jewels.  The suit should  be dismissed,  as A is not \nentitled  to their possession,  whatever  right  he may have  to secure  their safe \ncustody.  \n(c) A receives  a letter  addressed  to him by B. B gets back  the letter  without  A’s \nconsent.  A has such a property  therein  as entitles  him to recover  it from  B. \n(d) A deposit  books  and papers  for safe custody  with B. B loses  them  and C finds  \nthem,  but refuses  to deliver  them  to B when  demanded.  B may recover  them  \nfrom  C, subject  to C’s right,  if any, under  section  168 of the Contract  Act, \n1872  (IX of 1872). \n(e) A, a warehouse­keeper,  is charged  with the delivery  of certain  goods  to Z, \nwhich  B takes  out of A’s possession.  A may sue B for the goods.  \n \n \n \n1The original  words  “the Government”  were  first subs.  by A. O., 1937  (w.e.f.  1st April,  1937)  and then amended  by A. O., 1949  (w.e.f.  28th March,  \n1949)  to read as above.  \n2Subs.  by F. A. O., 1975,  Art. 2, for “Central  Government”  (w.e.f . 28th July,  1975).  \n3See now the Code  of Civil  Procedure,  1908  (Act 5 of 1908).  \nPage 9 of 35  \n \n  11. Liability of person in possession, not as owner, to deliver to person entitled to \nimmediate possession.  Any person having the possession or control of a particular article of \nmoveable property,  of which he is not the owner, may be co mpelled specifically to deliver it to the \nperson entitled to its  immediate possession, in any of the following cases :__ \n(a) when the thing claimed is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the \nclaimant;  \n(b) when  compensation  in money  would  not afford  the claimant  adequate  relief  \nfor the loss of the thing  claimed;  \n(c) when  it would  be extremely  difficult  to ascertain  the actual  damage  caused  by \nits loss; \n(d) when  the possession  of the thing  claimed  has been  wrongfully  transferred  \nfrom  the claimant.  \nIllustrations  \nof clause  (a)— \n A, proceeding  to Europe,  leaves  his furniture  in charge  of B as his agent  during  his absence.  \nB, without  A’s authority,  pledges  the furniture  to C, and C, knowing  that B had no right  to pledge  the \nfurniture,  advertises  it for sale. C may be compelled  to deliver  the furniture  to A, for he holds  it as \nA’s trustee.  \nof clause  (b)— \n Z has got possession  of an idol belonging  to A’s family,  and of which  A is the proper  \ncustodian.  Z may be compelled  to deliver  the idol to A. \nof clause  (c) \n A is entitled  to a picture  by a dead  painter  and a pair of rare China  vases.  B has possession  of \nthem.  The articles  are of too special  a character  to bear an ascertainable  market­value.  B may be \ncompelled  to deliver  them  to A. \nCHAPTER  II \nOF THE  SPECIFIC  PERFORMANCE  OF CONTRACTS  \n(a) Contracts  which  may be specifically  enforced  \n 12. Cases  in which  specific  performance  enforceable.  Except  as otherwise  provided  in this \nChapter,  the specific  performance  of any contract  may in the discretion  of the Court  be enforced___ \n(a)  when  the act agreed  to be done  is in the performance,  wholly  or partly,  of a \ntrust;  \n  \nPage 10 of 35  \n \n (b) when  1[their]  exists  no standard  for ascertaining  the actual  damage  caused  by \nnon­ performance  of the act agreed  to be done;  \n(c) when  the act agreed  to be done  is such that pecuniary  compensation  for its \nnon­performance  would  not afford  adequate  relief;  or \n(d) when  it is probable  that pecuniary  compensation  cannot  be got for the \nnon­performance  of the act agreed  to be done.  \n Explanation.___ Unless  and until the contrary  is proved,  the Court  shall  presume  that the \nbreach  of a contract  to transfer  immoveable  property  cannot  be adequately  relieved  by compensation  \nin money,  and that the breach  of a contract  to transfer  moveable  property  can be thus relieved.  \nIllustrations  \n 2* * * * * * * \nof clause  (b)— \n A agrees  to buy, and B agrees  to sell, a picture  by a dead  painter  and two rare China  vases.  A \nmay compel  B specifically  to perform  this contract,  for there  is no standard  for ascertaining  the \nactual  damage  which  would  be caused  by its non­performance.  \nof clause  (c)— \n A contracts  with B to sell him a house  for Rs. 1,000.  B is entitled  to a decree  directing  A to \nconvey  the house  to him, he paying  the purchase­money.  \n In consideration  of being  released  from  certain  obligations  imposed  on it by its act of \nIncorporation,  a railway­company  contract  with Z to make  an archway  through  their railway  to \nconnect  lands  of Z served  by the railway,  to construct  a road between  certain  specified  points,  to pay \na certain  annual  sum towards  the maintenance  of this road,  and also to construct  a siding  and a wharf  \nas specified  in the contract.  Z is entitled  to have  this contract  specifically  enforced,  for his interest  in \nits performance  cannot  be adequately  compensated  for by money:  and the Court  may appoint  a \nproper  person  to superintend  the construction  of the archway,  road,  siding  and wharf.  \n A contracts  to sell, and B contracts  to buy, a certain  number  of railway  shares  of a particular  \ndescription.  A refuses  to complete  the sale. B may compel  A specifically  to perform  this agreement,  \nfor the shares  are limited  in number  and not always  to be had in the market,  and their possession  \ncarries  with it the status  of a shareholder,  which  cannot  otherwise  be procured.  \n A contracts  with B to paint  a picture  for B, who agrees  to pay therefor  Rs. 1,000.  The picture  \nis painted.  B is entitled  to have  it delivered  to him on payment  or tender  of the Rs. 1,000.  \n  \n \n1See. should read “there”.  \n2The first Illustration omitted by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s.3 and 2nd Sch.  \n \n  \n  \nPage 11 of 35  \n \n of clause (d) — \nA transfers without endorsement, but for valuable consideration, a promissory note to B. A becomes \ninsolvent, and C is appointed his assignee. B may compel C to endorse the note, for C has succeeded \nto A’s liabilities, and a decree for pecuniary compensation for not endorsing the note would be \nfruitless.  \n 13. Contract  of which  the subject  has partially  ceased  to exist. Notwithstanding  anything  \ncontained  in section  56 of the Contract  Act, a contract  is not wholly  impossible  of performance  \nbecause  a portion  of its subject  matter,  existing  at its date,  has ceased  to exist  at the time of the \nperformance.  \n 1*  *  * * * * * * \n 14. Specific  performance  of part of contract  where  part unperformed  is small.  Where  a \nparty  to a contract  is unable  to perform  the whole  of his part of it, but the part which  must  be left \nunperformed  bears  only a small  proportion  to the whole  in value,  and admits  of compensation  in \nmoney,  the Court  may,  at the suit of either  party,  direct  the specific  performance  of so much  of the \ncontract  as can be performed,  and award  compensation  in money  for the deficiency.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A contracts  to sell B a piece  of lane consisting  of 100 bighas.  It turns  out that \n98 bighas  of the land belong  to A, and the two remaining  bighas  to a stranger,  \nwho refuses  to part with them.  The two bighas  are not necessary  for the use or \nenjoyment  of the 98 bighas,  nor so important  for such use of enjoyment  that \nthe loss of them  may not be made  good  in money.  A may be directed  at the \nsuit of B to convey  to B the 98 bighas  and to make  compensation  to him for \nnot conveying  the two remaining  bighas  ; or B may be directed,  at the suit of \nA, to pay to A, on receiving  the conveyance  and possession  of the land,  the \nstipulated  purchase­money  less a sum awarded  as compensation  for the \ndeficiency.  \n(b) In a contract  for the sale and purchase  of a house  and lands  for two lakhs  of \nrupees,  it is agreed  that part of the furniture  should  be taken  at a valuation.  The \nCourt  may direct  specific  performance  of the contract  notwithstanding  the \nparties  are unable  to agree  as to the valuation  of the furniture,  and may either  \nhave  the furnitur e valued  in the suit and include  it in the decree  for specific  \nperformance,  or may confine  its decree  to the house.  \n 15. Specific  performance  of part of contract  where  part unperformed  is large.  Where  a \nparty  to a contract  is unable  to perform  the whole  of his part of it, and the part which  must  be left \nunperformed  forms  a considerable  portion  of the whole,  or does not admit  of compensation  in \nmoney,  he is not entitled  to obtain  a decree  for specific  performance.  But the Court  may,  at the suit \nof the other  party  direct  the party  in default  to perform  specifically  so much  of his part of the contract  \nas he can perform,  provided  that the plaintiff  relinquishes  all claim  to further  performance,  and all \nright  to compensation  either  for the deficiency,  or for the loss or damage  sustained  by him through  \nthe default  of the defendant.  \n \n \n1Omitted by Ord. No. XXII of 1983, s.2.  \nPage 12 of 35  \n \n Illustrations  \n(a) A contracts  to sell to B a piece  of land consisting  of 100 bighas.  It turns  out \nthat 50 bighas  of the land belong  to A, and the other  50 bighas  to a stranger,  \nwho refuses  to part with them.  A cannot  obtain  a decree  against  B for the \nspecific  performance  of the contract;  but if B is willing  to pay the price  agreed  \nupon,  and to take the 50 bighas  which  belong  to A, waiving  all right  to \ncompensation  either  for the deficiency  or for loss sustained  by him through  \nA’s neglect  or default,  B is entitled  to a decree  directing  A to convey  those  50 \nbighas  to him on payment  of the purchase­money.  \n(b) A contracts  to sell to B an estate  with a house  and garden  for a lakh of rupees.  \nThe garden  is important  for the enjoyment  of the house.  It turns  out that A is \nunable  to convey  the garden.  A cannot  obtain  a decree  against  B for the \nspecific  performance  of the contract,  but if B is willing  to pay the price  agreed  \nupon,  and to take the estate  and house  without  the garden,  waiving  all right  to \ncompensation  either  for the deficiency  or for loss sustained  by him through  \nA’s neglect  or default,  B is entitled  to a decree  directing  A to convey  the house  \nto him on payment  of the purchase­money.  \n 16. Specific  performance  of independent  part of contract.  When  a part of a contract  \nwhich,  taken  by itself,  can and ought  to be specifically  performed,  stands  on a separate  and \nindependent  footing  from  another  part of the same  contract  which  cannot  or ought  not to be \nspecifically  performed,  the Court  may direct  specific  performance  of the former  part. \n 17. Bar in other  cases  of specific  performance  of part of contract.  The Court  shall  not \ndirect  the specific  performance  of a part of a contract  except  in cases  coming  under  one or other  of \nthe three  last preceding  sections.  \n 18. Purchaser’s  rights  against  vendor  with  imperfect  title.  Where  a person  contracts  to \nsell or let certain  property,  having  only an imperfect  title thereto,  the purchaser  or lessee  (except  as \notherwise  provided  by this Chapter)  has the following  rights:__ \n(a) if the vendor  or lessor  has subsequently  to the sale or lease  acquired  any \ninterest  in the property,  the purchaser  or lessee  may compel  him to make  good  \nthe contract  out of such interest;  \n(b) where  the concurrence  of other  persons  is necessary  to validate  the title, and \nthey are bound  to convey  at the vendor’s  or lessor’s  request,  the purchaser  or \nlessee  may compel  him to procure  such concurrence;  \n(c) where  the vendor  professes  to sell unincumbered  property,  but the property  is \nmortgaged  for an amount  not exceeding  the purchase­money,  and the vendor  \nhas in fact only a right  to redeem  it, the purchaser  may compel  him to redeem  \nthe mortgage  and to obtain  a conveyance  from  the mortgagee;  \n(d) where  the vendor  or lessor  sues for specific  performance  of the contract,  and \nthe suit is dismissed  on the ground  of his imperfect  title, the defendant  has a \nright  to a return  of his deposit  (if any) with interest  thereon,  to his costs  of the \nsuit, and to a lien for such deposit,  interest  and costs  on the interest  of the \nvendor  or lessor  in the property  agreed  to be sold or let. \nPage 13 of 35  \n \n  19. Power  to award  compensation  in certain  cases.  Any person  suing  for the specific  \nperformance  of a contract  may also ask for compensation  for its breach,  either  in addition  to, or in \nsubstitution  for, such performance.  \n If in any such suit the Court  decides  that specific  performance  ought  not to be granted,  but \nthat there  is a contract  between  the parties  which  has been  broken  by the defendant  and that the \nplaintiff  is entitled  to compensation  for that breach,  it shall  award  him compensation  accordingly.  \n If in any such suit the Court  decides  that specific  performance  ought  to be granted,  but that it \nis not sufficient  to satisfy  the justice  of the case,  and that some  compensation  for breach  of the \ncontract  should  also be made  to the plaintiff,  it shall  award  him such compensation  accordingly.  \n Compensation  awarded  under  this section  may be assessed  in such manner  as the Court  may \ndirect.  \nExplanation.__ The circumstance  that the contract  has become  incapable  of specific  \nperformance  does not preclude  the Court  from  exercising  the jurisdiction  conferred  by this section.  \nIllustrations  \nof the second  paragraph___ \n A contracts  to sell a hundred  maunds  of rice to B. B brings  a suit to compel  A to perform  the \ncontract  or to pay compensation.  The Court  is of opinion  that A has made  a valid  contract  and has \nbroken  it, without  excuse,  to the injury  of B, but that specific  performance  is not the proper  remedy.  \nIt shall  award  to B such compensation  as it deems  just. \nof the third  paragraph___ \n A contracts  with B to sell him a house  for Rs. 1,000,  the price  to be paid and the possession  \ngiven  on the 1st January  1877.  A fails to perform  his part of the contract,  and B brings  his suit for \nspecific  performance  and compensation,  which  is decided  in his favour  on the 1st January,  1878.  The \ndecree  may,  besides  ordering  specific  performance,  award  to B compensation  for any loss which  he \nhas sustained  by A’s refusal.  \nof the Explanation___ \n A, a purchaser,  sues B, his vendor,  for specific  performance  of a contract  for the sale of a \npatent.  Before  the hearing  of the suit the patent  expires.  The Court  may award  A compensation  for \nthe non­ performance  of the contract,  and may,  if necessary,  amend  the plaint  for that purpose.  \n A sues for the specific  performance  of a resolution  passed  by the Directors  of a public  \ncompany,  under  which  he was entitled  to have  a certain  number  of shares  allotted  to him, and for \ncompensation  for the non­performance  of the resolution.  All the shares  had been  allotted  before  the \ninstitution  of the suit. The Court  may,  under  this section,  award  A compensation  for the \nnon­performance.  \n 20. Liquidation  of damages  not a bar to specific  performance.  A contract,  otherwise  \nproper  to be specifically  enforced,  may be thus enforced,  though  a sum be named  in it as the amount  \nto be paid in case of its breach,  and the party  in default  is willing  to pay the same.  \n \nPage 14 of 35  \n \n Illustration  \n A contracts  to grant  B an under­lease  of property  held by A under  C, and that he will apply  to \nC for a license  necessary  to the validity  of the under­lease,  and that, if the license  is not procured,  A \nwill pay B Rs. 10,000.  A refuses  to apply  for the license  and offers  to pay B the Rs. 10,000.  B is \nnevertheless  entitled  to have  the contract  specifically  enforced  if C consents  to give the license.  \n(b) Contracts  which  cannot  be specifically  enforced  \n 21. Contracts  not specifically  enforceable.  The following  contracts  cannot  be specifically  \nenforced:___ \n(a) a contract  for the non­performance  of which  compensation  in money  is an \nadequate  relief;  \n(b) a contract  which  runs into such minute  or numerous  details,  or which  is so \ndependent  on the personal  qualifications  or volition  of the parties,  or otherwise  \nfrom  its nature  is such,  that the Court  cannot  enforce  specific  performance  of \nits material  terms;  \n(c) a contract  the terms  of which  the Court  cannot  find with reasonable  certainty;  \n(d) a contract  which  is in its nature  revocable;  \n(e) a contract  made  by trustees  either  in excess  of their powers  or in breach  of \ntheir trust;  \n(f) a contract  made  by or on behalf  of a corporation  or public  company  created  for \nspecial  purposes,  or by the promoters  of such company,  which  is in excess  of \nits powers;  \n(g) a contract  the performance  of which  involves  the performance  of a continuous  \nduty extending  over a longer  period  than three  years  from  its date;  \n(h) a contract  of which  a material  part of the subject­matter,  supposed  by both \nparties  to exist,  has, before  it has been  made,  ceased  to exist.  \n And,  save as provided  by the 1[Arbitration  Act, 1940  (X of 1940 )], no contract  to refer  \n2[present  or future  differences]  to arbitration  shall  be specifically  enforced;  3but if any person  who \nhas made  such a contract  4[other  than an arbitration  agreement  to which  the provisions  of the said \nAct apply]  and has refused  to perform  it sues in respect  of any subject  which  he has contracted  to \nrefer,  the existence  of such contract  shall  bar the suit. \n  \n1Subs. by the Arbitration Act,1940 (10 of 1940), s. 49 and IV Sch., (w.e.f. 1st July, 1940) for “Code of Civil Procedure, [and the Indian Arbitration Act, \n1899,]”.

A and B each name  a valuer,  but before  the valuation  is made,  A instructs  his \nvaluer  not to proceed:  \n By a charter­party  entered  into in 2[Chittagong]  between  A, the owner  of a ship,  and B, the charterer,  \nit is agreed  that the ship shall  proceed  to 3[Karachi]  and there  load a cargo  of rice, and thence  proceed  to \nLondon,  freight  to be paid,  one­third  on arrival  at 3[Karachi],  and two­thirds  on delivery  of the cargo  in \nLondon : \n A lets land to B and B contracts  to cultivate  it in a particular  manner  for three  years  next after the date \nof the lease:  \n A and B contract  that, in consideration  of annual  advances  to be made  by A, B will for three  years  \nnext after the date of the contract  grow  particular  crops  on the land in his possession  and deliver  them  to A \nwhen  cut and ready  for delivery:  \n A contracts  with B that, in consideration  of Rs.1,000  to be paid to him by B, he will paint  a picture  for \nB : \n A contracts  with B to execute  certain  works  which  the Court  cannot  superintend:  A contracts  to \nsupply  B with all the goods  of a certain  class  which  B may require:  \n A contracts  with B to take from  B a lease  of a certain  house  for a specified  term,  at a specified  rent, \"if \nthe drawing­room  is handsomely  decorated,\"  even  if it is held to have  so much  certainty  that compensation  \ncan be recovered  for its breach:  \n \n1Subs. by F.A.O., 1975, Art. 2, for “Central Government” ( w.e.f  . 28th July, 1975) which had be en subs. by A.

A refuses,  to perform  his \ncontract.  The case is one for compensation  and not for specific  performance,  the amount  and the \nnature  of the accommodation  and appliances  being  undefined.  \nTo (d)___ \n A and B contract  to become  partners  in a certain  business,  the contract  not specifying  the \nduration  of the proposed  partnership.  This contract  cannot  be specifically  performed,  for, if it were  so \nperformed,  either  A or B might  at once  dissolve  the partnership.  \nto (e)___ \n A is a trustee  of land with power  to lease  it for seven  years.  He enters  into a contract  with B \nto grant  a lease  of the land for seven  years,  with a covenant  to renew  the lease  at the expiry  of the \nterm.  This contract  cannot  be specifically  enforced.  \n The Directors  of a company  have  power  to sell the concern  with the sanction  of a general  \nmeeting  of the shareholders.  They  contract  to sell it without  any such sanction.  This contract  cannot  \nbe specifically  enforced.  \n Two trustees,  A and B, empowered  to sell trust­property  worth  a lakh of rupees,  contract  to \nsell it to C for Rs. 30,000.  The contract  is so disadvantageous  as to be a breach  of trust.  C cannot  \nenforce  its specific  performance.  \n The promoters  of a company  for working  mines  contract  that the company,  when  formed,  \nshall  purchase  certain  mineral  property.  They  take no proper  precautions  to ascertain  the value  of \nsuch property__ and in fact agree  to pay an extravagant  price  therefor.  They  also stipulate  that the \nvendors  shall  give them  a bonus  out of the purchase­money.  This contract  cannot  be specifically  \nenforced.  \nto (f)___ \n A company  existing  for the sole purpose  of making  and working  a railway  contract  for the \npurchase  of a piece  of land for the purpose  of erecting  a cottonmill  thereon.  This contract  cannot  be \nspecifically  enforced.  \nto (g)___ \n A contracts  to let for twenty­one  years  to B the right  to use such part of a certain  railway  \nmade  by A as was upon  B’s land,  and that B should  have  a right  of running  carriages  over the whole  \nline on certain  terms,  and might  require  A to supply  the necessary  engine­power,  and that A should  \nduring  the term keep  the whole  railway  in good  repair.  Specific  performance  of this contract  must  be \nrefused  to B. \nPage 17 of 35  \n \n to (h)___ \n A contracts  to pay an annuity  to B for the lives  of C and D. It turns  out that, at the date of the \ncontract,  C, though  supposed  by A and B to be alive,  was dead.  The contract  cannot  be specifically  \nperformed.  \n(c) Of the Discretion  of the Court  \n 22. Discretion  as to decreeing  specific  performance.  The jurisdiction  to decree  specific  \nperformance  is discretionary,  and the Court  is not bound  to grant  such relief  merely  because  it is \nlawful  to do so; but the discretion  of the Court  is not arbitrary  but sound  and reasonable,  guided  by \njudicial  principles  and capable  of correction  by a Court  of appeal.  \n The following  are cases  in which  the Court  may properly  exercise  a discretion  not to decree  \nspecific  performance:___ \n I. Where  the circumstances  under  which  the contract  is made  are such as to give the plaintiff  \nan unfair  advantage  over the defendant,  though  there  may be no fraud  or misrepresentation  on the \nplaintiff’s  part. \nIllustrations  \n(a) A, a tenant  for life of certain  property,  assigns  his interest  therein  to B. C \ncontracts  to buy, and B contracts  to sell, that interest.  Before  the contract  is \ncompleted,  A receives  a mortal  injury  from  the effects  of which  he dies the \nday after the contract  is executed.  If B and C were  equally  ignorant  or equally  \naware  of the fact, B is entitled  to specific  performance  of the contract.  If B \nknew  the fact, and C did not, specific  performance  of the contract  should  be \nrefused  to B. \n(b) A contracts  to sell to B the interest  of C in certain  stock­in­trade.  It is \nstipulated  that the sale shall  stand  good,  even  though  it should  turn out that C’s \ninterest  is worth  nothing.  In fact, the value  of C’s interest  depends  on the result  \nof certain  partnership­accounts,  on which  he is heavily  in debt to his partners.  \nThis indebtedness  is known  to A, but not to B. Specific  performance  of the \ncontract  should  be refused  to A. \n(c) A contracts  to sell, and B contracts  to buy, certain  land.  To protect  the land \nfrom  floods,  it is necessary  for its owner  to maintain  an expensive  \nembankment.  B does not know  of this circumstance,  and A conceals  it from  \nhim. Specific  performance  of the contract  should  be refused  to A. \n(d) A’s property  is put up to auction.  B requests  C, A’s attorney,  to bid for him. C \ndoes this inadvertently  and in good  faith.  The persons  present,  seeing  the \nvendor’s  attorney  bidding,  think  that he is a mere  puffer  and cease  to compete.  \nThe lot is knocked  down  to B at a low price.  Specific  performance  of the \ncontract  should  be refused  to B. \n II. Where  the performance  of the contract  would  involve  some  hardship  on the defendant  \nwhich  he did not foresee,  whereas  its non­performance  would  involve  no such hardship  on the \nplaintiff.  \nPage 18 of 35  \n \n Illustrations  \n 1*  *  *  *  *  *  * \n(f) A and B, trustees,  join their beneficiary,  C, in a contract  to sell the trust­estate  \nto D, and personally  agree  to exonerate  the estate  from  heavy  encumbrances  to \nwhich  it is subject.  The purchase­money  is not nearly  enough  to discharge  \nthose  encumbrances,  though,  at the date of the contract,  the vendors  believed  it \nto be sufficient.  Specific  performance  of the contract  should  be refused  to D. \n(g) A, the owner  of an estate,  contracts  to sell it to B, and stipulates  that he, A, \nshall  not be obliged  to define  its boundary.  The estate  really  comprises  a \nvaluable  property,  not known  to either  to be part of it. Specific  performance  of \nthe contract  should  be refused  to B unless  he waives  his claim  to the unknown  \nproperty.  \n(h) A contracts  with B to sell him certain  land,  and to make  a road to it from  a \ncertain  railway­station.  It is found  afterwards  that A cannot  make  the road \nwithout  exposing  himself  to litigation.  Specific  performance  of the part of the \ncontract  relating  to the road should  be refused  to B, even  though  it may be \nheld that he is entitled  to specific  performance  of the rest with compensation  \nfor loss of the road.  \n(i) A, a lessee of mines, contracts with B, his lessor, that at any time during the \ncontinuance of the lease B may give notice of his desire to take the machinery \nand plant used in and about the mines, and that he shall have the articles \nspecified in his notice delivered to him at a valuation on the expiry of the \nlease. Such a contract might be most injurious to the lessee’s business, and \nspecific performance of it should be refused to B.  \n(j) A contracts to buy certain la nd from B. The contract is silent as to access to \nthe land. No right of way to it can be shown to exist. Specific performance of \nthe contract should be refused to B.  \n(k) A contracts with B to buy from B’s manufactory and not elsewhere all the \ngoods of a ce rtain class used by A in his trade. The Court cannot compel B to \nsupply the goods, but if he does not supply them, A may be ruined unless he is \nallowed to buy them elsewhere. Specific performance of the contract should \nbe refused to B.  \n The following is a case in which the Court may properly exercise a discretion to decree \nspecific performance:  \n III. Where the plaintiff has done substantial acts or suffered losses in consequence of a \ncontract capable of specific performance.  \n \n \n1Omitted  by Ord. XXII  of 1983,  s.3. \n \n  \nPage 19 of 35  \n \n Illustration  \n A sells land to a railway­company,  who contract  to execute  certain  works  for his \nconvenience.  The company  take the land and use it for their railway.  Specific  performance  of the \ncontract  to execute  the works  should  be decreed  in favour  of A. \n(d) For whom  Contracts  may be specifically  enforced  \n 23. Who  may obtain  specific  performance.  Except  as otherwise  provided  by this Chapter,  \nthe specific  performance  of a contract  may be obtained  by___ \n(a) any party  thereto;  \n(b) the representative  in interest , or the principal,  of any party  thereto:  provided  \nthat, where  the learning,  skill,  solvency  or any personal  quality  of such party  is \na material  ingredient  in the contract,  or where  the contract  provides  that his \ninterest  shall  not be assigned,  his representative  in interest  or his principal  \nshall  not be entitled  to specific  performance  of the contract,  unless  where  his \npart thereof  has already  been  performed;  \n(c)  where  the contract  is a settlement  on marriage,  or a compromise  of doubtful  \nrights  between  members  of the same  family,  any person  beneficially  entitled  \nthere  under;  \n(d)  where  the contract  has been  entered  into by a tenant  for life in due exercise  of \na power,  the remainder  man;  \n(e) a reversioner  in possession,  where  the agreement  is a covenant  entered  into \nwith his predecessor  in title and the reversioner  is entitled  to the benefit  of \nsuch covenant;  \n(f) a reversioner  in remainder,  where  the agreement  is such a covenant,  and the \nreversioner  is entitled  to the benefit  thereof  and will sustain  material  injury  by \nreason  of its breach;  \n(g) when  a public  company  has entered  into a contract  and subsequently  becomes  \namalgamated  with another  public  company,  the new company  which  arises  out \nof the amalgamation;  \n(h) when  the promoters  of a public  company  have,  before  its incorporation,  \nentered  into a contract  for the purposes  of the company,  and such contract  is \nwarranted  by the terms  of the incorporation,  the company.  \n(e) For whom  Contracts  cannot  be specifically  enforced.  \n 24. Personal  bars  to the relief.  Specific  performance  of a contract  cannot  be enforced  in \nfavour  of a person__ \n(a)  who could  not recover  compensation  for its breach;  \n \nPage 20 of 35  \n \n (b) who has become  incapable  of performing,  or violates,  any essential  term of the \ncontract  that on his part remains  to be performed;  \n(c) who has already  chosen  his remedy  and obtained  satisfaction  for the alleged  \nbreach  of contract;  or \n(d)  who,  previously  to the contract,  had notice  that a settlement  of the \nsubject­matter  thereof  (though  not founded  on any valuable  consideration)  had \nbeen  made  and was then in force.  \nIllustrations  \nto clause  (a)___ \n A, in the character  of agent  for B, enters  into an agreement  with C to buy C’s house.  A is in \nreality  acting,  not as agent  for B, but on his own account.  A cannot  enforce  specific  performance  of \nthis contract.  \nto clause  (b) \n A contracts  to sell B a house  and to become  tenant  thereof  for a term of fourteen  years  from  \nthe date of the sale at a specified  yearly  rent. A becomes  insolvent.  Neither  he nor his assignee  can \nenforce  specific  performance  of the contract.  \n A contracts  to sell B a house  and garden  in which  there  are ornamental  trees,  a material  \nelement  in the value  of the property  as a residence.  A, without  B’s consent,  fells the trees.  A cannot  \nenforce  specific  performance  of the contract.  \n A, holding  land under  a contract  with B for a lease,  commits  waste,  or treats  the land in an \nunhusband  like manner.  A cannot  enforce  specific  performance  of the contract.  \n A contracts  to let, and B contracts  to take,  an unfinished  house,  B contracting  to finish  the \nhouse  and the lease  to contain  covenants  on the part of A to keep  the house  in repair.  B finishes  the \nhouse  in a very defective  manner:  he cannot  enforce  the contract  specifically,  though  A and B may \nsue each other  for compensation  for breach  of it. \nto clause  (c) \n A contracts  to let, and B contracts  to take,  a house  for a specified  term at a specified  rent. B \nrefuses  to perform  the contract.  A thereupon  sues for, and obtains,  compensation  for the breach.  A \ncannot  obtain  specific  performance  of the contract.  \n 25. Contracts  to sell property  by one who has no title or who is a voluntary  settler.  A \ncontract  for the sale or letting  of property,  whether  moveable  or immoveable,  cannot  be specifically  \nenforced  in favour  of a vendor  or lessor – \n(a) who,  knowing  himself  not to have  any title to the property,  has contracted  to \nsell or let the same;  \n(b) who,  though  he entered  into the contract  believing  that he had a good  title to \nthe property,  cannot , at the time fixed  by the parties  or by the Court  for the \ncompletion  of the sale or letting,  give the purchaser  or lessee  a title free from  \nPage 21 of 35  \n \n reasonable  doubt;  \n(c) who,  previous  to entering  into the contract,  has made  settlement  (though  not \nfounded  on any valuable  consideration)  of the subject­matter  of the contract.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A, without  C’s authority,  contracts  to sell to B an estate  which  A knows  to \nbelong  to C. A cannot  enforce  specific  performance  of this contract,  even  \nthough  C is willing  to confirm.  \n(b) A bequeaths  his land to trustees  declaring  that they may sell it with the consent  \nin writing  of B. B gives  a general  prospective  assent  in writing  to any sale \nwhich  the trustees  may make.  The trustees  then enter  into a contract  with C to \nsell him the land.  C refuses  to carry  out the contract.  The trustees  cannot  \nspecifically  enforce  this contract,  as in the absence  of B’s consent  to the \nparticular  sale to C, the title which  they can give C is, as the law stands,  not \nfree from  reasonable  doubt.  \n(c) A, being  in possession  of certain  land,  contracts  to sell it to Z. On inquiry  it \nturns  out that A claims  the land as heir of B, who left the country  several  years  \nbefore,  and is generally  believed  to be dead,  but of whose  death  there  is no \nsufficient  proof.  A cannot  compel  Z specifically  to perform  the contract.  \n(d) A, out of natural  love and affection,  makes  a settlement  of certain  property  on \nhis brothers  and their issue,  and afterwards  enters  into a contract  to sell the \nproperty  to a stranger.  A cannot  enforce  specific  performance  of this contract  \nso as to override  the settlement,  and thus prejudice  the interests  of the persons  \nclaiming  under  it. \n(f) For whom  Contracts  cannot  be specifically  enforced,  except  with a Variation  \n 26. Non enforcement  except  with  variation.  Where  a plaintiff  seeks  specific  performance  of \na contract  in writing,  to which  the defendant  sets up a variation,  the plaintiff  cannot  obtain  the \nperformance  sought,  except  with the variation  so set up, in the following  cases  (namely):__ \n(a) where  by fraud  or mistake  of fact the contract  of which  performance  is sought  \nis in terms  different  from  that which  the defendant  supposed  it to be when  he \nentered  into it ; \n(b)  where  by fraud,  mistake  of fact, or surprise  the defendant  entered  into the \ncontract  under  a reasonable  misapprehension  as to its effect  as between  \nhimself  and the plaintiff  ; \n(c) where  the defendant,  knowing  the terms  of the contract  and understanding  its \neffect,  has entered  into it relying  upon  some  misrepresentation  by the plaintiff,  \nor upon  some  stipulation  on the plaintiff’s  part, which  adds to the contract,  but \nwhich  he refuses  to fulfill  ; \n(d) where  the object  of the parties  was to produce  a certain  legal  result,  which  the \ncontract  as framed  is not calculated  to produce;  \nPage 22 of 35  \n \n (e) where  the parties  have,  subsequently  to the execution  of the contract,  \ncontracted  to vary it. \nIllustrations  \n(a) A, B and C sign a writing  by which  they purport  to contract  each to enter  into \na bond  to D for Rs. 1,000.  In a suit by D, to make  A, B and C separately  liable  \neach to the extent  of Rs. 1,000,  they prove  that the word  “each”  was inserted  \nby mistake;  that the intention  was that they should  give a joint bond  for Rs. \n1,000.  D can obtain  the performance  sought  only with the variation  thus set \nup. \n(b) A sues B to compel  specific  performance  of a contract  in writing  to buy a \ndwelling­house.  B proves  that he assumed  that the contract  included  an \nadjoining  yard,  and the contract  was so framed  as to leave  it doubtful  whether  \nthe yard was so included  or not. The Court  will refuse  to enforce  the contract,  \nexcept  with the variation  set up by B. \n(c) A contracts  in writing  to let to B a wharf,  together  with a strip of A’s land \ndelineated  in a map.  Before  signing  the contract,  B proposed  orally  that he \nshould  be at liberty  to substitute  for the strip mentioned  in the contract  another  \nstrip of A’s land of the same  dimensions,  and to this A expressly  assented.  B \nthen signed  the written  contract.  A cannot  obtain  specific  performance  of the \nwritten  contract,  except  with the variation  set up by B. \n(d) A and B enter  into negotiations  for the purpose  of securing  land for B for his \nlife, with remainder  to his issue.  They  execute  a contract,  the terms  of which  \nare found  to confer  an absolute  ownership  on B. The contract  so framed  \ncannot  be specifically  enforced.  \n(e) A contracts  in writing  to let a house  to B, for a certain  term,  at the rent of Rs. \n100 per month,  putting  it first into tenantable  repair.  The house  turns  out to be \nnot worth  repairing,  so, with B’s consent,  A pulls  it down  and erects  a new \nhouse  in its place:  B contracting  orally  to pay rent at Rs. 120 per mensum.  B \nthen sues to enforce  specific  performance  of the contract  in writing.  He cannot  \nenforce  it except  with the variations  made  by the subsequent  oral contract.  \n(g) Against  whom  contracts  may be specifically  enforced.  \n27. Relief  against  parties  and persons  claiming  under  them  by subsequent  title.  Except  as \notherwise  provided  by this Chapter,  specific  performance  of a contract  may be enforced  against___ \n(a) either  party  thereto;  \n(b) any other  person  claiming  under  him by a title arising  subsequently  to the \ncontract,  except  a transferee  for value  who has paid his money  in good  faith \nand without  notice  of the original  contract;  \n(c) any person  claiming  under  a title which,  though  prior  to the contract  and \nknown  to the plaintiff,  might  have  been  displaced  by the defendant;  \n(d) when  a public  company  has entered  into a contract  and subsequently  becomes  \nPage 23 of 35  \n \n amalgamated  with another  public  company,  the new company  which  arises  out \nof the amalgamation;  \n(e) when  the promoters  of a public  company  have,  before  its incorporation,  \nentered  into a contract,  the company:  provided  that the company  has ratified  \nand adopted  the contract  and the contract  is warranted  by the terms  of the \nincorporation.  \nIllustrations  \nto clause  (b)___ \n A contracts  to convey  certain  land to B by a particular  day, A dies intestate  before  that day \nwithout  having  conveyed  the land.  B may compel  A’s heir or other  representative  in interest  to \nperform  the contract  specifically.  \n A contracts  to sell certain  land to B for Rs. 5,000.  A afterwards  conveys  the land for Rs. \n6,000  to C, who has notice  of the original  contract.  B may enforce  specific  performance  of the \ncontract  as against  C. \n A contracts  to sell land to B for Rs. 5,000.  B takes  possession  of the land.  Afterwards  A sells \nit to C for Rs. 6,000.  C makes  no inquiry  of B relating  to his interest  in the land.  B’s possession  is \nsufficient  to affect  C with notice  of his interest,  and he may enforce  specific  performance  of the \ncontract  against  C. \n A contracts,  in consideration  of Rs. 1,000,  to bequeath  certain  of his lands  to B. Immediately  \nafter the contract  A dies intestate,  and C takes  out administration  to his estate.  B may enforce  \nspecific  performance  of the contract  against  C. \n A contracts  to sell certain  land to B. Before  the completion  of the contract,  A becomes  a \nlunatic  and C is appointed  his committee.  B may specifically  enforce  the contract  against  C. \nto clause  (c)___ \n A, the tenant  for life of an estate,  with remainder  to B, in due exercise  of a power  conferred  \nby the settlement  under  which  he is tenant  for life, contracts  to sell the estate  to C, who has notice  of \nthe settlement.  Before  the sale is completed,  A dies. C may enforce  specific  performance  of the \ncontract  against  B. \n A and B are joint tenants  of land,  his undivided  moiety  of which  either  may alien  in his \nlifetime,  but which,  subject  to that right,  devolves  on the survivor.  A contracts  to sell his moiety  to C \nand dies. C may enforce  specific  performance  of the contract  against  B. \n 1[27A. Specific performance in case of part performance of contract to lease.  Subject to \nthe provisions of this Chapter, where a contract to lease immoveable property is made in writing \nsigned by the parties thereto or on their behalf, either party may, notwithstanding that the contract, \nthough required to be registered, has not be en registered, sue the other for specific performance of \nthe contract if,___ \n \n1S. 27A ins. by the Transfer of Property (Amdt.) Supplementary Act, 1929 (21 of 1929), s. 3 ( w.e.f . 1st April, 1930).  \n  \nPage 24 of 35  \n \n (a) where  specific  performance  is claimed  by the lessor,  he has delivered  \npossession  of the property  to the lessee  in part performance  of the contract;  \nand \n(b) where  specific  performance  is claimed  by the lessee,  he has, in part \nperformance  of the contract,  taken  possession  of the property,  or, being  \nalready  in possession,  continues  in possession  in part performance  of the \ncontract,  and has done  some  act in furtherance  of the contract:  \n Provided  that nothing  in this section  shall  affect  the rights  of a transferee  for consideration  \nwho has no notice  of the contract  or of the part performance  thereof.  \n This section  applies  to contracts  to lease  executed  after the first day of April,  1930.]  \n(h) Against  whom  Contracts  cannot  be specifically  enforced  \n 28. What  parties  cannot  be compelled  to perform.  Specific  performance  of a contract  \ncannot  be enforced  against  a party  thereto  in any of the following  cases:__ \n(a) if the consideration  to be received  by him is so grossly  inadequate,  with \nreference  to the state of things  existing  at the date of the contract,  as to be \neither  by itself  or coupled  with other  circumstances  evidence  of fraud  or of \nundue  advantage  taken  by the plaintiff  ; \n (b) if his assent  was obtained  by the misrepresentation  (whether  willful  or \ninnocent),  concealment,  circumvention  or unfair  practices,  of any party  to \nwhom  performance  would  become  due under  the contract,  or by any promise  \nof such party  which  has not been  substantially  fulfilled;  \n(c) if his assent  was given  under  the influence  of mistake  of fact, misapprehension  \nor surprise:  Provided  that, when  the contract  provides  for compensation  in \ncase of mistake,  compensation  may be made  for a mistake  within  the scope  of \nsuch provision,  and the contract  may be specifically  enforced  in other  respects  \nif proper  to be so enforced.  \nIllustrations   \nto clause  (c)___ \n A, one of two executors,  in the erroneous  belief  that he had the authority  of his co­executor,  \nenters  into an agreement  for the sale to B of his testator’s  property.  B cannot  insist  on the sale being  \ncompleted.  \n A directs  an auctioneer  to sell certain  land.  A afterwards  revokes  the auctioneer’s  authority  as \nto 20 bighas  of this land,  but the auctioneer  inadvertently  sells the whole  to B, who has not notice  of \nthe revocation.  B cannot  enforce  specific  performance  of the agreement.  \n(i) The effect  of dismissing  a Suit for Specific  Performance  \n 29. Bar of suit for breach  after  dismissal.  The dismissal  of a suit for specific  performance  \nof a contract  or part thereof  shall  bar the plaintiff’s  right  to sue for compensation  for the breach  of \nsuch contract  or part, as the case may be. \nPage 25 of 35  \n \n  \n(j) Awards  and Directions  to execute  Settlements  \n 30. Application  of preceding  sections  to awards  and testamentary  directions  to execute  \nsettlements.  The provisions  of this Chapter  as to contracts  shall,  mutatis  mutandis , apply  to awards  \nand to directions  in a will or codicil  to execute  a particular  settlement.  \n___________  \nCHAPTER  III \nOF THE  RECTIFICATION  OF INSTRUMENT  \n 31. When  instrument  may be rectified.  When,  through  fraud  or a mutual  mistake  of the \nparties,  a contract  or other  instrument  in writing  does not truly  express  their intention,  either  party,  or \nhis representative  in interest,  may institute  a suit to have  the instrument  rectified;  and if the Court  \nfind it clearly  proved  that there  has been  fraud  or mistake  in framing  the instrument,  and ascertain  the \nreal intention  of the parties  in executing  the same,  the Court  may in its discretion  rectify  the \ninstrument  so as to express  that intention,  so far as this can be done  without  prejudice  to rights  \nacquired  by third  persons  in good  faith and for value.  \nIllustrations  \n(a)  A, intending  to sell to B his house  and one of three  godowns  adjacent  to it, \nexecutes  a conveyance  prepared  by B, in which,  through  B’s fraud,  all three  \ngodowns  are included.  Of the two godowns  which  were  fraudulently  included,  \nB gives  one to C and lets the other  to D for a rent, neither  C nor D having  any \nknowledge  of the fraud.  The conveyance  may,  as against  B and C, be rectified  \nso as to exclude  from  it the godown  given  to C; but it cannot  be rectified  so as \nto affect  D’s lease.  \n(b) By a marriage  settlement,  A, the father  of B, the intended  wife,  covenants  with \nC, the intended  husband,  to pay to C, his executors,  administrators  and \nassigns,  during  A’s life, an annuity  of Rs. 5,000.  C dies insolvent  and the \nofficial  assignee  claims  the annuity  from  A. The Court,  on finding  it clearly  \nproved  that the parties  always  intended  that this annuity  should  be paid as a \nprovision  for B and her children,  may rectify  the settlement  and decree  that the \nassignee  has no right  to any Part of the annuity.  \n 32. Presumption  as to intent  of parties.  For the purpose  of rectifying  a contract  in writing,  \nthe Court  must  be satisfied  that all the parties  thereto  intended  to make  an equitable  and \nconscientious  agreement.  \n 33. Principles  of rectification.  In rectifying  a written  instrument,  the Court  may inquire  what  \nthe instrument  was intended  to mean,  and what  were  intended  to be its legal  consequences,  and is not \nconfined  to the inquiry  what  the language  of the instrument  was intended  to be. \n 34. Specific  enforcement  of rectified  contract.  A contract  in writing  may be first rectified  \nand then,  if the plaintiff  has so prayed  in his plaint  and the Court  thinks  fit, specifically  enforced.  \n \nPage 26 of 35  \n \n Illustration  \n A contracts  in writing  to pay his attorney,  B, a fixed  sum in lieu of costs.  The contract  \ncontains  mistakes  as to the name  and rights  of the client,  which,  if construed  strictly,  would  exclude  \nB from  all rights  under  it. B is entitled,  if the Court  thinks  fit, to have  it rectified,  and to an order  for \npayment  of the sum,  as if at the time of its execution  it had expressed  the intention  of the parties.  \n____________  \nCHAPTER  IV \nOF THE  RESCISSION  OF CONTRACTS  \n 35. When  rescission  may be adjudged.  Any person  interested  in a contract  in writing  1may \nsue to have  it rescinded,  and such rescission  may be adjudged  by the Court  in any of the following  \ncases,  namely:__ \n(a)  where  the contract  is voidable  or terminable  by the plaintiff  ; \n(b)  where  the contract  is unlawful  for causes  not apparent  on its face,  and the \ndefendant  is more  to blame  than the plaintiff  ; \n(c) where  a decree  for specific  performance  of a contract  of sale, or of a contract  \nto take a lease,  has been  made,  and the purchaser  or lessee  makes  default  in \npayment  of the purchase­money  or other  sums  which  the Court  has ordered  \nhim to pay. \n When  the purchaser  or lessee  is in possession  of the subject­matter,  and the Court  finds  that \nsuch possession  is wrongful,  the Court  may also order  him to pay to the vendor  or lessor  the rents  \nand profits,  if any, received  by him as such possessor.  \n In the same  case,  the Court  may,  by order  in the suit in which  the decree  has been  made  and \nnot complied  with,  rescind  the contract,  either  so far as regards  the party  in default,  or altogether  as \nthe justice  of the case may require.  \nIllustrations   \nto (a)___ \n A sells a field to B. There  is a right  of way over the field of which  A has direct  personal  \nknowledge,  but which  he conceals  from  B. B is entitled  to have  the contract  rescinded.  \nto (b)___ \n A, an attorney,  induces  his client  B, a Hindu  widow,  to transfer  property  to him, for the \npurpose  of defrauding  B’s creditors.  Here  the parties  are not equally  in fault,  and B is entitled  to have  \nthe instrument  of transfer  rescinded.  \n \n \n1The words “in writing” are rep. wherever the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), is in force, see ss. 1 and 2 of that Act.  \nPage 27 of 35  \n \n  36. Rescission  for mistake.  Rescission  of a contract  in writing1 cannot  be adjudged  for mere  \nmistake,  unless  the party  against  whom  it is adjudged  can be restored  to substantially  the same  \nposition  as if the contract  had not been  made.  \n 37. Alternative  prayer  for rescission  in suit for specific  performance.  A plaintiff  \ninstituting  a suit for the specific  performance  of a contract  in writing  may pray in the alternative  that, \nif the contract  cannot  be specifically  enforced,  it may be rescinded  and delivered  up to be cancelled;  \nand the Court,  if it refuses  to enforce  the contract  specifically,  may direct  it to be rescinded  and \ndelivered  up accordingly.  \n 38. Court  may require  party  rescinding  to do equity.  On adjudging  the rescission  of a \ncontract,  the Court  may require  the party  to whom  such relief  is granted  to make  any compensation  \nto the other  which  justice  may require.  \n___________  \nCHAPTER  V \nOF THE  CANCELLATION  OF INSTRUMENTS  \n 39. When  cancellation  may be ordered.  Any person  against  whom  a written  instrument  is \nvoid or voidable,  who has reasonable  apprehension  that such instrument,  if left outstanding,  may \ncause  him serious  injury,  may sue to have  it adjudged  void or voidable;  and the Court  may,  in its \ndiscretion,  so adjudge  it and order  it to be delivered  up and cancelled.  \n If the instrument  has been  registered  under  the Indian  Registration  Act2, the Court  shall  also \nsend a copy  of its decree  to the officer  in whose  office  the instrument  has been  so registered;  and \nsuch officer  shall  note on the copy  of the instrument  contained  in his books  the fact of its \ncancellation.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A, the owner  of a ship by fraudulently  representing  her to be seaworthy,  \ninduces  B, an underwriter,  to insure  her. B may obtain  the cancellation  of the \npolicy.  \n(b) A conveys  land to B, who bequeaths  it to C and dies. Thereupon  D gets \npossession  of the land and produces  a forged  instrument  stating  that the \nconveyance  was made  to B in trust for him. C may obtain  the cancellation  of \nthe forged  instrument.  \n(c) A, representing  that the tenants  on his land were  all at will, sells it to B, and \nconveys  it to him by an instrument,  dated  the 1st January  1877.  Soon  after that \nday, A fraudulently  grants  to C a lease  of part of the lands,  dated  the 1st \nOctober,  1876,  and procures  the lease  to be registered  under  the Indian  \nRegistration  Act.3 B may obtain  the cancellation  of this lease.  \n \n \n1The words  “in writing”  are rep. wherever  the Transfer  of Property  Act, 1882  (4 of 1882),  is in force,  see ss. 1 and 2 of that Act. \n2See now the Registration  Act, 1908  (16 of 1908).  \n3See now the Registration  Act, 1908  (16 of 1908).  \nPage 28 of 35  \n \n (d) A agrees  to sell and deliver  a ship to B, to be paid for by B’s acceptances  of four \nbills of exchange,  for sums  amounting  to Rs, 30,000  to be drawn  by A on B. The \nbills are drawn  and accepted,  but the ship is not delivered  according  to the \nagreement.  A sues B on one of the bills,  B may obtain  the cancellation  of all the \nbills.  \n 40. What  instruments  may be partially  cancelled.  Where  an instrument  is evidence  of different  \nrights  or different  obligations,  the Court  may,  in a proper  case,  cancel  it in part and allow  it to stand  for \nthe residue.  \nIllustration  \nA draws  a bill on B, who endorses  it to C, by whom  it appears  to be endorsed  to D, who endorses  it to E. \nC’s endorsement  is forged.  C is entitled  to have  such endorsement  cancelled,  leaving  the bill to stand  in \nother  respects.  \n 41. Power  to require  party  for whom  instrument  is cancelled  to make  compensation.  On \nadjudging  the cancellation  of an instrument,  the Court  may require  the party  to whom  such relief  is \ngranted  to make  any compensation  to the other  which  justice  may require.  \n_________  \nCHAPTER  VI \nOF DECLARATORY  DECREES  \n  1[42. Discretion of Court as to declaration of status or right .— (1) Any person entitled \nto any character, or any right to any property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or \ninterested to deny, his title to such character or right, and the Court may in its discretion make therein a \ndeclaration that he is  so entitled and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any further relief:  \nProvided that no Court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, being able to seek \nfurther re lief than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so.  \n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, a suit \nfiled under sub -section (1) shall be decided by the Court within six months and the appellate court shall \ndecide the appeal not later than ninety days, as the case may b e.] \n 43. Effect  of declaration.  A declaration  made  under  this Chapter  is binding  only on the parties  to \nthe suit, persons  claiming  through  them  respectively,  and, where  any of the parties  are trustees,  on the \npersons  for whom,  if in existence  at the date of the declaration,  such parties  would  be trustees.  \nIllustration  \n A, a Hindu, in a suit to which B, his alleged wife, and her mother, are defendants, seeks a \ndeclaration that his marriage was duly solemnized and an order for the restitution of his conjugal  rights. \nThe Court makes the declaration and order. C, claiming that B is his wife, then sues A for the recovery of \nB. The declaration made in the former suit is not binding upon C.  \n \n1Subs., by Act XXXIII of 2023, s.2.   \nPage 29 of 35  \n \n CHAPTER  VII \nOF THE  APPOINTMENT  OF RECEIVERS  \n 44. Appointment  of receivers  discretionary.  The appointment  of a receiver  pending  a suit is a \nmatter  resting  in the discretion  of the Court.  \n Reference  to Code  of Civil  Procedure.  The mode  and effect  of his appointment,  and his rights,  \npowers  duties  and liabilities,  are regulated  by the Code  of Civil  Procedure1. \nCHAPTER  VIII. ____ [Of the Enforcement  of Public  Duties.]  Omitted  by the Federal  Laws  \n(Revision  and Declaration  ) Ordinance,  1981  (XXVII  of 1981),  s. 3 and IInd Sch. \nPART  III \nOf Preventive  Relief  \n___________  \nCHAPTER  IX \nOF INJUNCTIONS  GENERALLY  \n 52. Preventive  relief  how granted.  Preventive  relief  is granted  at the discretion  of the Court  by \ninjunction,  temporary  or perpetual.  \n 53. Temporary  injunctions.  Temporary  injunctions  are such as are to continue  until a specified  \ntime,  or until the further  order  of the Court.  They  may be granted  at any period  of a suit, and are regulated  \nby the 2[Code  of Civil  Procedure,  1908  (Act V of 1908 ).] \n Perpetual  Injunctions.  A perpetual  injunction  can only be granted  by the decree  made  at the \nhearing  and upon  the merits  of the suit: the defendant  is thereby  perpetually  enjoined  from  the assertion  \nof a right,  or from  the commission  of an act, which  would  be contrary  to the rights  of the plaintiff.  \n_____________  \nCHAPTER  X \nOF PERPETUAL  INJUNCTIONS  \n 54. Perpetual  injunctions  when  granted.  Subject  to the other  provisions  contained  in, or \nreferred  to by, this Chapter,  a perpetual  injunction  may be granted  to prevent  the breach  of an obligation  \nexisting  in favour  of the applicant,  whether  expressly  or by implication.  \n When  such obligation  arises  from  contract,  the Court  shall  be guided  by the rules  and provisions  \ncontained  in Chapter  II of this Act. \n When  the defendant  invades  or threatens  to invade  the plaintiff’s  right  to, or enjoyment  of, \nproperty,  the Court  may grant  a perpetual  injunction  in the following  cases  (namely):__ \n(a) where  the defendant  is trustee  of the property  for the plaintiff  ; \n \n1See now the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act 5 of 1908).  \n2Subs. by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s. 3 and 2nd Sch., for “Code of Civil Proc edure”. \nPage 30 of 35  \n \n (b) where  there  exists  no standard  for ascertaining  the actual  damage  caused,  or \nlikely  to be caused,  by the invasion;  \n(c) where  the invasion  is such that pecuniary  compensation  would  not afford  \nadequate  relief;  \n(d) where  it is probable  that pecuniary  compensation  can not be got for the \ninvasion;  \n(e) where  the injunction  is necessary  to prevent  a multiplicity  of judicial  \nproceedings.  \nExplanation .___ For the purpose  of this section  a trademark  is property  . \nIllustrations  \n(a) A lets certain  lands  to B and B contracts  not to dig sand or gravel  thereout.  A \nmay sue for an injunction  to restrain  B from  digging  in violation  of his \ncontract.  \n(b) A trustee  threatens  a breach  of trust.  His co­trustees,  if any, should,  and the \nbeneficial  owners  may,  sue for an injunction  to prevent  the breach.  \n(c) The directors  of a public  company  are about  to pay a dividend  1out of capital  \nor borrowed  money.  Any of the shareholders  may sue for an injunction  to \nrestrain  them.  \n(d) The directors  of a fire and life­insurance  company  are about  to engage  in \nmarine  insurances.  Any of the shareholders  may sue for an injunction  to \nrestrain  them.  \n(e) A, an executor,  through  misconduct  or insolvency,  is bringing  the property  of \nthe deceased  into danger.  The Court  may grant  an injunction  to restrain  him \nfrom  getting  in the assets.  \n(f) A, a trustee  for B, is about  to make  an imprudent  sale of a small  part of the \ntrust­property.  B may sue for an injunction  to restrain  the sale, even  though  \ncompensation  in money  would  have  afforded  him adequate  relief.  \n(g) A makes  a settlement  (not founded  on marriage  or other  valuable  \nconsideration)  of an estate  on B and his children.  A then contracts  to sell the \nestate  to C. B or any of his children  may sue for an injunction  to restrain  the \nsale. \n(h) In the course  of A’s employment  as a vakil,  certain  papers  belonging  to his \nclient,  B, come  into his possession.  A threatens  to make  these  papers  public,  or \nto communicate  their contents  to a stranger.  B may sue for an injunction  to \nrestrain  A from  so doing.  \n \n \n1A Railway Company may, however, pay interest on its paid­up share capital out of capital, for a certain period and subject to  certain restrictions and \nconditions: see the Indian Railway Companies Act, 1895 (10 of 1895), s.3.  \nPage 31 of 35  \n \n (i) A is B’s medical  adviser.  He demands  money  of B which  B declines  to pay. A \nthen threatens  to make  known  the effect  of B’s communications  to him as a \npatient.

B may sue for an \ninjunction  to restrain  them  from  so doing.  \n(k) A lets certain  arable  lands  to B for purposes  of husbandry,  but without  any \nexpress  contract  as to the mode  of cultivation.  Contrary  to the mode  of \ncultivation  customary  in the district,  B threatens  to sow the lands  with seed \ninjurious  thereto  and requiring  many  years  to eradicate.  A may sue for an \ninjunction  to restrain  B from  sowing  the lands  in contravention  of his implied  \ncontract  to use them  in a husband  like manner.  \n(l) A, B and C are partners,  the partnership  being  determinable  at will.

B may obtain  an injunction  \nto restrain  the publication.  \n(g) In the cases  put as illustrations  (v) and (w) to section  54 and in illustrations  (e) \nand (f) to this section,  the Court  may also order  the copies  produced  by piracy,  \nand the trade­marks,  statements  and communications,  therein  respectively  \nmentioned,  to be given  up or destroyed.  \n 56. Injunction  when  refused.  An injunction  cannot  be granted__ \n(a)  to stay a judicial  proceeding  pending  at the institution  of the suit in which  the \ninjunction  is sought,  unless  such restraint  is necessary  to prevent  a multiplicity  \nof proceedings;  \n(b) to stay proceedings  in a Court  not subordinate  to that from  which  the \ninjunction  is sought;  \n(c) to restraint  persons  from  applying  to any legislative  body;  \n(d) to interfere  with the public  duties  of any department  of 1[the 2[Federal  \nGovernment],  3* * * or any Provincial  Government],  or with the sovereign  \nacts of a Foreign  Government;  \n(e) to stay proceedings  in any criminal  matter;  \n(f) to prevent  the breach  of a contract  the performance  of which  would  not be \nspecifically  enforced;  \n(g) to prevent, on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasonably clear \nthat it will be a nuisance;  \n \n1Subs. by A. O.,1937 for “the G. of I. or the L.G.”. (w.e.f.1st April, 1937).  \n2Subs. by F. A. O., 1975, Art. 2, for “Central Government” (w.e.f. 28th July, 1975).  \n3The words “the Crown Representative” omitted by A. O., 1949, Sch., (w.e.f. 28th March, 1949).  \n  \nPage 34 of 35  \n \n  (h) to prevent  a continuing  breach  in which  the applicant  has acquiesced;  \n(i) when  equally  efficacious  relief  can certainly  be obtained  by any other  usual  \nmode  of proceeding  except  in case of breach  of trust;  \n(j) when  the conduct  of the applicant  or his agents  has been  such as to disentitle  \nhim to the assistance  of the Court;  \n(k) where  the applicant  has no personal  interest  in the matter.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A seeks  an injunction  to restrain  his partner,  B, from  receiving  the \npartnership­debts  and effects.  It appears  that A had improperly  possessed  \nhimself  of the books  of the firm and refused  B access  to them.  The Court  will \nrefuse  the injunction.  \n(b) A manufactures  and sells crucibles,  designating  them  as “patent  plum­bago  \ncrucibles,”  though,  in fact, they have  never  been  patented.  B pirates  the \ndesignation.  A cannot  obtain  an injunction  to restrain  the piracy.  \n(c) A sells an article  called  “Mexican  Balm,”  stating  that it is compounded  of \ndivers  rare essences,  and has sovereign  medicinal  qualities.  B commences  to \nsell a similar  article  to which  he gives  a name  and description  such as to lead \npeople  into the belief  that they are buying  A’s Mexican  Balm.  A sues B for an \ninjunction  to restrain  the sale. B shows  that A’s Mexican  Balm  consists  of \nnothing  but scented  hog’s  lard. A’s use of his description  is not an honest  one \nand he cannot  obtain  an injunction.  \n 57. Injunction  to perform  negative  agreement.  Notwithstanding  section  56, clause  (f), \nwhere  a contract  comprises  an affirmative  agreement  to do a certain  act, coupled  with a negative  \nagreement,  express  or implied,  not to do a certain  act, the circumstance  that the Court  is unable  to \ncompel  specific  performance  of the affirmative  agreement  shall  not preclude  it from  granting  an \ninjunction  to perform  the negative  agreement:  provided  that the applicant  has not failed  to perform  \nthe contract  so far as it is binding  on him. \nIllustrations  \n(a) A contracts  to sell to B for Rs.1,000  the good­will  of a certain  business  \nunconnected  with business­premises,  and further  agrees  not to carry  on that \nbusiness  in 1[Karachi].  B pays A the Rs. 1,000  but A carries  on the business  in \n1[Karachi].  The Court  cannot  compel  A to send his customers  to B, but B may \nobtain  an injunction  restraining  A from  carrying  on the business  in 1[Karachi].  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1Subs. by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981) s. 3 and 2nd Sch., for “Chittagong” which w as subs. by the \nCentral Laws (Statute Reform) Ordinance, 1960 (21 of 1960), s. 3 and 2nd Sch., for “Calcutta” (w.e.f. 14th October, 1955).  \n \nPage 35 of 35  (b) A contracts  to sell to B the good­will  of a business.  A then sets up a similar  \nbusiness  close  by B’s shop  and solicits  his old customers  to deal with him. \nThis is contrary  to his implied  contract,  and B may obtain  an injunction  to \nrestrain  A from  soliciting  the customers,  and from  doing  any act whereby  their \ngood­will  may be withdrawn  from  B. \n(c) A contracts  with B to sing for twelve  months  at B’s theatre  and not to sing in \npublic  elsewhere.  B cannot  obtain  specific  performance  of the contract  to sing,  \nbut he is entitled  to an injunction  restraining  A from  singing  at any other  place  \nof public  entertainment.  \n(d) B contracts  with A that he will serve  him faithfully  for twelve  months  as a \nclerk.  A is not entitled  to a decree  for specific  performance  of the contract.  But \nhe is entitled  to an injunction  restraining  B from  serving  a rival house  as clerk.  \n(e) A contracts  with B that, in consideration  of Rs.l,000  to be paid to him by B on \na day fixed,  he will not set up a certain  business  within  a specified  distance.  B \nfails to pay the money.  A cannot  be restrained  from  carrying  on the business  \nwithin  the specified  distance.  \nSCHEDULE.___ [Enactments Repealed] Rep. by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1891 (X II of \n1891)."
