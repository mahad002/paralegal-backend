Court may grant protection -order. The Court, if satisfied of the fact of such desertion, \nand that the same was without reasonable excuse, and that the wife is maintaining herself by her own \nindustry or property, may make and give to the wife an order protecting her earnings and other \nproperty from her husband and all creditors and persons claiming under him. Every such order shall \nstate the time at which the desertion commenced, and shall, as regards all persons dealing with the \nwife in relian ce thereon, be conclusive as to such time.  \n \n 1Succession Act, 1925 ( Act No. XXXIX  of 1925).  \n 2Subs. by Act , 1975 ( Act No. IV of 1976), s.  15. \n \n              \nPage 11 of 26 \n             29.
