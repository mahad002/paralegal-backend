G.”. \n \nPage 12 of 20 \n 23. Contr ol of Collec tor as guardian.   A Collector appointed or declare d by the C ourt to be \nguardia n of the person or property, or both, of a minor shall, in all matters  connecte d with the \nguardianship of his ward, be subject to the control of the l[provincial Government] or of such \nauthority as that Government, by 2notification in the official Gazette, appoints in this behalf.  \nGuardian of the Person  \n24. Duties of guardian of the person. A guardian of the person of a ward is charged with \nthe custody  of the ward and must look to his support,  health and education and such other \nmatters as the law to which the ward is subject requires. \n25. Title of guardian to custody of ward.—(1) If a ward leaves or is removed from the \ncustody  of a guardian of his person,  the Court, if it is of opinion  that it will be for the welfare \nof the ward to return to the custody  of his guardian, may make an order for his return, and for the \npurpose  of enforcing the order may cause the ward to be arrested and to be delivered into the \ncustody of the guardian. \n \n(2) For the purpose  of arresting  the ward, the Court may exercise the power conferred on a \nMagistrate of the first class by section 100 of the 3[Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898] (Act V of \n1898).  \n \n(3) The residence of a ward against the will of his guardian with a person who is not his \nguardian does not of itself terminate the guardianship.  \n \n26. Removal of ward from jurisdiction.—(1) A guardian of the person appoint ed or \ndeclared by the  Court, unless he is the Collector or is a guardian appoin ted by will  or other \ninstru ment, shall not, without the leave of the Court by whi ch he was appointed or declared, remove  \nthe  w ard  from  the  li mits  of its jurisd iction  except  for such  purposes  as may be pr escribed. \n \n(2) The leave granted by the Court under sub-section (1) may be special or general, and \nmay be defined by the order granting it. \n \nGuardian  of Prop erty \n \n27. Duties of guardian of property. A guardian of the property of a ward is bound  to deal \ntherewith as carefully as a man of ordinary prudence would  deal with it if it were his own,  and, \nsubject to the provisions  of this Chapter, he may do all acts which are reasonable and proper for \nthe realisation, protection or benefit of the property. \n \n28. Powers of testamentary guardian. Where a guardian has been appoin ted by will or \nother instru ment, his power to mortgage or charge, or transfer by sale, gift, exchange or otherwise, \nimmoveable property belonging to his ward is subject to any restriction which may be imposed by \nthe instru ment, unless he has under this Act been declared guardian and the Court which made \nthe declaration permits him by an order in writin g, notwithst anding  the restriction,  to  dispose  \nof any  immoveable  property  specified  in  the  order  in  a  manner permitted by the order. \n \n \n  1Subs. by A.O., 1937, for “L. G.”. \n 2For notification appointing authorities to whose control collectors appointed under the act shall be subject, se e different local R& O.   3Subs. by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s. 3 and 2nd Sch., for “Code of Civil Proc edure, \n 1882.”.  \n \nPage 13 of 20 \n 29. Limitation of powers of guardian of property appointed or declared by the Court. \nWhere a person other than a Collector, or than a guardian appointed by will or other instru ment, \nhas been appointed or declared by the Court to be guardian of the property of a ward, he shall \nnot, without the previous permission of the Court,— \n  \n(a)       mortgage or charge, or transfer by sale, gift, exchange or otherwise, any \npart of the immoveable property of his ward, or \n (b)       lease any part of that property for a term exceeding five years or for any \nterm extending  more than one year beyond the date on which the ward will \ncease to be a minor.  \n30. Voidability of transfers made in contravention of section 28 or section 29. A \ndispos al of immoveable prop erty by a guardian in contravention of  either of the two last \nforegoing sections  is voidable at the instance of any other person affected thereby. \n31. Practice with  respect to permitting transfers under section 29.—(1) Permission to \nthe guardian to do any of the acts mentioned in section 29 shall not be granted by the Court except \nin case of necessity or for an evident advantage to the ward. \n(2) The order granting  the permission  shall recite the necessity or advantage, as the case \nmay be, describe the property with respect to whi ch the act permitted is to be  done, and specify \nsuch conditions,  if any, as the Court may see fit to attach to the permission;  and it shall be \nrecorded, dated and signed by the Judge of the Court with his own hand, or when from any \ncause he is prevented from recording  the order with his own hand, shall be taken down  in \nwriting  from his dictation and be dated and signed by him. \n(3) The Court may in its  discretion attach to the  permission  the following  among other \nconditions,  namely:— \n(a)  that a sale shall not be completed without  the sanction of the Court;  \n(b)  that a sale shall be made to the highest bidder by public  auction, before the \n  Court or some person specially appoint ed by the Court for that purpos e, at \n  a time  and place to be specified by the Court, after such proclamation of \n  the intended sale as the Court, subject to any rules made under this Act  \n  by the  High Court, directs; \n(c)  that a lease shall not be made in consideration of a premium or shall be \nmade for such term of years and subject to such rents and covenants as the \nCourt directs ; \n(d)  that the whole  or any part of the proceeds of the act permitted shall be \npaid into the Court by the  guardian, to be disburs ed therefrom or to be \ninvested by the Court on prescribed securities or to be otherwise disposed of \nas the Court directs. \n(4) Before granting  permission  to a guardian to do an act mentioned in section 29, the Court \nmay cause notice of the application for the permission  to be given to any relative or friend of \nthe ward who should,  in its  opinion,  receive notice thereof, and shall hear and record the statement \nof any person who appears in oppos ition to the application. \n \nPage 14 of 20 \n 32. Variation  of powers of guardian of property appointed or declared by the Court. \nWhere a guardian of the property of a ward has been appoin ted or declared by the Court and \nsuch guardian is not the Collector, the Court may, from time to time, by order, define, restrict \nor extend his powers with respect to the property of the ward in such manner and to such extent as \nit may consider to be for the advantage of the ward and consistent with the law to which the ward \nis subject. \n33. Right of guardian so appointed or declared to apply to the Court for opinion in \nmanagement of property of ward.—(1) A guardian appointed or declared by the Court may \napply by petition  to the Court which appointed or declared him for its opinion,  advice or direction  \non  any  present  question  respecting  the  management  or  administr ation  of  the property of his \nward. \n(2) If the Court considers the question  to be proper for summary dispos al, it shall cause \na copy of the petition to be served on, and the hearing thereof may be attended by, such of the \npersons  interested in the application as the Court thinks  tit. \n(3) The guardian stating in 1good faith the facts in the  petition and acting upon  the opinion,  \nadvice or direction given by the Court shall be deemed, so far as regards his own responsibil ity, to \nhave performed his duty as guardian in the subject matter of the application. \n34. Obligatio ns on guardian of  property appointed or declared by the Court. Where a \nguardian of the property of a ward has been appoin ted or declared by the  Court and such guardian \nis not the Collector, he shall,— \n(a)       if so required by the Court, give a bond,  as nearly as may be in the \n prescribed form, to the  Judge of the Court to ensure  for the benefit of the \n Judge for the time being, with or without  sureties, as may be prescribed, \n engaging duly to account for what he may receive in respect of the property \n of the ward; \n(b)       if so required by the Court, deliver to the Court, within  six months  from \nthe date of his appoint ment or declaration by the Court or within such \nother  time as the Court directs, a statement of the immovable property \nbelonging to the  ward, of the money and other moveable property which he \nhas received on behalf of the ward up to the date of delivering the \nstatement, and of the debts due on that date to or from the ward; \n(c)       if so required by the  Court, exhibit  his accounts  in the Court at such times and \nin such form as the Court from time to time directs; \n(d)      if so required by the Court, pay into the Court at such time as the Court directs the \nbalance due from him on those  accounts,  or so much thereof as the Court directs; and \n(e)      apply for the maintenance, education and advancement of the ward and of such \npersons  as are dependent on him, and for the celebration of ceremonies to which the ward or any \nof those  persons  may be a party, such portion  of the income of the property of the ward as the Court \nfrom time to time directs, and, if the Court so directs, the whole or any part of that property. \n 1For definition of ‘good faith’, see s. 3(20) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (10 of 1897).\n \nPage 15 of 20 \n 1[34A.  Power to award remuneration  for auditing accounts.  When accounts are \nexhibi ted by a guardian of the property of a ward in pursuance of a requisition  made under \nclause (c) of section 34 or otherwise, the Court may appoint  a person to audit the accounts, and \nmay direct that remuneration for the work  be paid out of the income of the property.] \n35.  Suit agai nst guardian where administration bond was ta ken.  Where  a guardian \nappoin ted or declared by the Court has given a bond  duly to account for what he may receive in \nrespect of the property of his ward, the Court may, on application made by petition  and on being \nsatisfied that the engagement of the bond  has not been kept, and upon such terms as to security, \nor providing that any money received be paid into the Court, or otherwise  as the Court thinks fit, \nassign the bond  to some proper person,  who shall thereupon be entitled to sue  on the bond  in his  \nown name as if the bond  had been originally given to him instead of to the  Judge of the Court and \nshall be entitled to recover thereon as trustee for the ward, in respect of any breach thereof. \n36. Suit against guardian where administration bond was not taken.—(1) Where a \nguardian appoin ted or declared by the Court has not given a bond  as aforesaid, any person, with \nthe leave of the Court, may, as next friend, at any time during  the contin uance of the minority  of \nthe ward, and upon  such terms as aforesaid, institute a suit against the guardian, or, in case of his \ndeath, against his representative, for an account of what the guardian has received in respect of the \nproperty of the ward, and may recover in the suit, as trust ee for the ward, such amount as may be \nfound  to be payable by the guardian or his representative, as the case may be. \n2*              *                      *                      *                      *                      *                     * \n37.  General liability of guardian as trustee. Nothing  in  either  of  the  two  last foregoing \nsections  shall be constru ed to deprive a ward or his  representative of any remedy against  his  \nguardian,  or  the  representative  of  the  guardian,  which,  not  being  expressly provided in either \nof those  sections,  any other beneficiary or his representative would  have against his trustee or the \nrepresentative of the trustee. \nTermination  of Guardia nship \n38. Right of survivorship among joint guardians.  On the death of one of two or more \njoint guardians, the guardianship  contin ues to the survivor or survivors until a further appoint ment \nis made by the Court.  \n39. Removal of guardian.  The Court may, on the application of any person interested, \nor of its own motion,  remove a guardian  appoint ed  or declared by the Court, or a guardian \nappoin ted by will or other instru ment, for any of the following  causes, namely:— \n(a)   for abuse of his trust;  \n \n(b)  for continu ed failure to perform the duties of his trust; (c) for incapacity to \nperform the duties of his trust; \n \n(d)  for ill—treatment, or neglect to take proper care, of his ward; \n \n(e)  for contumacious disregard of any provision  of this Act or of any order of the \nCourt;  \n \n 1S. 34A ins. by the Guardians and Wards (Amdt.)

Discharge of guardian.—(1) If a guardian appoin ted or declared by the Court desires \nto resign his office, he may apply to the Court to be discharged. \n(2) If  the  Court  finds  that  there  is  suf ficient  reason  for  the  application,  it  shall \ndischarge him, and if the guardian the application is the Collector and the l[Provincial Government] \napproves of is applying to be discharged, the Court shall in any case discharge him. \n41. Cessation of authority of guardian. —(1) The powers of a guardian of the pe rson \ncease— \n(a)  by his death, removal or discharge; \n  (b)  by the Court of Wards assuming superintendence of the person of the ward;  \n  (c)  by the ward ceasing to be a minor;  \n(d) in the case of a female ward, by her marriage to a hus band who is not  unfit to be \nguardian of her person or, if the guardian was appoint ed or declared by the Court, by her marriage \nto a husband who is not, in the opinion of the Court, so unfit; or, \n(e) in the case of a ward whose  father was unfit to be guardian of the person of the \nward, by the father ceasing to be so or, if the father was deemed by the Court to be so unfit, by his \nceasing to be so in the opinion  of the Court.  \n(2) The powers of a guardian of the property cease__ \n(a) by his death, removal or discharge; \n 1Subs. by A.O., 1937, for “L.

Orders for regulating conduct or proceedings of guardians, and enforcement of \nthose orders.—(1) The Court may, on the application of any person interested or of  its own \nmotion,  make an ord er regulating the condu ct or pro ceedings of any guardian appointed or declared \nby the Court.  \n \n(2) Where there are more guardians than one of a ward, and they are unable to agree upon  a \nquestion  affecting his welfare, any of them may apply to the Court for its direction, and the \nCourt may make such order respecting the matter in difference as it thinks  fit. \n \n(3) Except where it appears that the object of making an order under sub-section (1) or \nsub-section (2) would  be defeated by the  delay, the Court shall, before making the order, direct \nnotice of the application therefor or of the intention  of the Court to make it, as the case may be, to \nbe given, in a case under sub-section (1), to the guardian or, in a case under sub-section (2), to the \nguardian who has not made the application. \n \n (4) In case of disobedience to an order made under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the \norder may be enforced in the same manner as an injunction granted under l[rules 1 and 2 of order  \n \nXXXIX  of the First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908] (Act V of 1908) in a case \nunder sub-section (1), as if the ward were the plaintiff and the guardian were the defendant or, in a \ncase under sub-section (2), as if the guardian who made the application were the plaintiff and the \nother guardian were the defendant. \n(5) Except in a case under sub -section (2), nothing in this section shall apply to a  Collect or \nwho is, as such, a gu ardian.  \n \n 1Subs. by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s. 3 and 2nd Sch., for certain words.  \n \nPage 18 of 20 \n 44.
