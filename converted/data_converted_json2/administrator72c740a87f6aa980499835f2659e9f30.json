Definitions. -  In this Chapter, unless the re is anything repugnant in the subject or context, - \n \n \n(a) “at or about the same time”  means within ninety days prior to the importation or within \nninety days after the importation of goods being valued;  \n \n(b) “buying commissions”  means fee paid and declared in the  bill of entry by an importer to his \nagent for the service of representing the importer abroad in the purchase of the goods being \nvalued;  \n \n(c) “commercial level”  means the level of the transaction at which a sale is concluded and \nincludes the sales before and after importation of the goods for example,  \nsales conducted between a manufacturer and a wholeseller, or between a wholeseller and a \nretailer, or between a retailer and a customer;  \n \n(c) “family”  means a group of persons related to each other by marriage, blood or law or \nadoption and includes all descendants of a common progenitor;  \n \n(d) “general expenses” includes direct and indirect costs of marketing the goods after \nimportation;  \n \n (f) “produced”  includes goods grown, manufactured and mined; and  \n \n \nSUB -CHAPTER II \n \nGENERAL  \n \n108. Declaration  by the importer. -  The importer, or his agent, shall furnish -- \n \n(a) a declaration disclosing full and accurate details relating to the value of imported goods; and  \n \n(b) any other statement, information or document as considered necessary by the appropriate \nofficer for determination of the value of imported goods under the Act and this chapter.  \n \n \n109.   Burden of proof. -  (1)  Where the appropriate officer has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy \nof the particulars or of document s produced in support of the declaration, such officer may ask the importer to \nprovide further explanation, including documents or other evidence.  \n \n (2) If, after receiving information referred to in sub rule (1) or in the absence of a response, the \napprop riate officer still has reasonable doubts  about the truth or accuracy of the declared value, it may be \ndeemed that the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined under the provisions of sub -section \n(1) of section 25 of the Act.  \n   \n 433 \n  \n (3) When a  final decision is made, the appropriate officer shall communicate to the importer in \nwriting his decision and the grounds therefore.  \n \n110. Prohibited methods. -  Where the value of imported goods cannot be determined under sub -\nsection (1), (5), (6), (7) an d (8) of section 25 of the Act, the customs value shall be determined on the basis of \ndata of imports available with the Customs Department.  However no value shall be determined under this \nchapter  on the basis of -- \n \n (i) the selling price of the identic al goods produced in Pakistan;  \n(ii) the price of the goods in the domestic market of the country of origin except after allowing \ndeduction of local taxes and profits at each level of sale  in the country or exportations;  \n (iii) arbitrary or fictitious valu es; or  \n(iv) the minimum customs values, except those notified under sub -section (4) of section 25 of the \nAct. \n \n111.   Rights of Customs. -  Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as restricting, or \ncalling in question, the right of the appropr iate officer to satisfy himself as to the truth or accuracy of any \nstatement, information, document or declaration presented for valuation purposes by or on behalf of the \nimporter under the Act and rules made thereunder.  \n \n112.   Rights of importer. -  (1)  Whenever the appropriate officer is unable to accept the transaction \nvalue without further inquiry, he shall give the importer an opportunity to supply such further detailed \ninformation as may be necessary to enable him to examine the circumstances surroun ding the  sale.  In this \ncontext, the appropriate officer of customs shall examine relevant aspects of the transaction, including the way \nin which the buyer  and seller organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price in question \nwas arri ved at, in order to determine whether the  relationship influenced the price.  Where it can be shown that \nthe buyer and seller, although “related persons” as defined under clause (g) of rule  2  of chapter - I, buy from \nand sell to each other as if they wer e not related, this would demonstrate that the price had been settled in a \nmanner consistent with the normal pricing practice of the concerned industry or with the way the seller settles \nprices for sales to buyers who are not related  to him, this would de monstrate that the price has not been \ninfluenced by the relationship.  \n \n (2) Where it is shown that the price is adequate to ensure recovery of all costs plus a profit which \nis representative of the firm's overall profit realized over a representative perio d of time, for example, on an \nannual basis, in sales of goods of the same class or kind, this would demonstrate that the price had not been \ninfluenced.  \n \n \nSUB -CHAPTER  III  \n \nPRIMARY METHOD OF VALUATION  \n \n113.   Price actually paid or payable. -  (1)  The price  actually paid or payable is the total payment \nmade or to be made by the buyer to or for the benefit of the seller for the imported goods.  The payment need \nnot necessarily take the form of a transfer of money.  It may be made by way of letter of credit or  negotiable \ninstruments, or by cash or credit or partly by cash and partly by credit and may be made directly or indirectly.  \nAs example of an indirect payment would be the settlement by the buyer, whether in whole or in part, of a debt \nowned by the seller . \n \n(2) Activities undertaken by the buyer on his own account, other than those for which an \nadjustment is provided in sub -section (2) of section 25 of the Act are not considered to be an indirect payment \nto the seller, even though they might be regarded as  of benefit to the seller.  The costs of such activities shall \nnot, therefore, be added to the price actually paid or payable in determining the value of imported goods.  \n \n 434 \n  \n (3) The customs value of imported goods shall not include the following charges or co sts, \nprovided that they are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable for the imported goods, namely: - \n \n(i) charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance or technical assistance \nundertaken after importation of goods such as industri al plant, machinery or \nequipment;  \n  (ii) the cost of transport after importation; and  \n  (iii) duties and taxes in Pakistan.  \n \n (4) The price actually paid or payable refers to the price of the imported goods.  Thus the flow of \ndividends or other payments fr om the buyer to the seller, which do not relate to the imported goods,, shall not \nbe part of the customs value.  \n \n114.   Restrictions which do not affect value. -  Among restrictions which would not render a price \nactually paid or payable unacceptable are re strictions which do not substantially affect the value of the goods.  \nAn example of such restrictions would be the case where a seller requires a buyer of automobiles not to sell or \nexhibit them prior to a fixed date  which represents the beginning of a mo del year.  \n \n115.   Restrictions which affect value. -  If the sale or price is subject to some conditions or \nconsiderations for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the goods being valued, the transaction \nvalue shall not be acceptable for custo ms purposes.  For examples: - \n \n(a) the seller establishes the price of the imported goods on condition that the buyer will also buy \nother goods in specified quantities;  \n(b) the price of the imported goods is dependent upon the price, or prices, at which the  buyer of \nthe imported goods sells other goods to the seller of the imported goods; or  \n(c) the price is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the imported goods, \nsuch as where the imported goods are semi -finished goods which have been  provided by the \nseller on condition that he will receive a specified quantity of the finished goods.  \n \n Explanation. -  Conditions or considerations relating to the production or marketing of the imported \ngoods shall not result in rejection of the transacti on value.  For example, the fact that the buyer furnishes the \nseller with engineering and plans undertaken in Pakistan shall not result in rejection of the transaction value.  \nLikewise, if the buyer undertakes on his own account, even though by agreement w ith the seller, activities \nrelating to the marketing of the imported goods, the value of these activities shall not be part of the value of \nimported goods nor shall such activities  result in rejection of the transaction value.  \n \n116.   Transaction value ac ceptable in case of related parties. -  Where the buyer and seller are \nrelated, circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the \ncustoms value of imported goods provided that the relationship did not in fluence the price.  Where the \nappropriate officer has no doubts about the acceptability of the price, it may be accepted without requesting \nfurther information from the importer.  For example, the appropriate officer may have previously examined the \nrelati onship, or he may already have detailed information concerning the buyer and the seller, and may already \nbe satisfied from such examination or information that the relationship did not influence the price.  \n \nSUB -CHAPTER  IV  \n \n  SECONDARY METHODS OF VALUATION  \n \n117.   Transaction value of identical goods. -  (1)  In applying sub -section (5) of section 25 of the \nAct, the appropriate officer shall, wherever possible use a sale of identical goods at the same commercial level \nand in substantially the same quantities  as the goods being valued.  Where no such sale is found, a sale of \nidentical goods that takes place under any one of the following conditions may be used, namely: - \n \n  (i) a sale at the same commercial level but in different quantities;  \n 435 \n  \n (ii) a sale at diff erent commercial level but in substantially the same quantities; or  \n  (iii) a sale at a different commercial level and in different quantities.  \n \n (2) Having found a sale under any one of the conditions referred to in sub -rule (1), adjustments \nshall then be  made, as the case may be, for the following, namely: - \n \n  (i) quantity factors only;  \n  (ii) commercial level factors only; or  \n  (iii) both commercial level and quantity factors.  \n  \n (3) For the purposes of sub -section (5) of section 25 of the Act, the trans action value of identical \nimported goods means a value, adjusted as provided for in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of sub -section (5) of that \nsection, which has already been accepted under sub -section (1) of the said section 25.  \n \n (4) A condition for adjustment because of different commercial levels or different quantities \nshall be that such adjustment, whether it leads to  an increase or a decrease in the value, be made only on the \nbasis of demonstrated evidence that clearly establishes the reasonableness and  a ccuracy of the adjustment, \ne.g., valid price lists containing prices referring to different levels or different quantities.  As an example of \nthis, if the imported goods being valued consist of a shipment of ten units and the only identical goods for \nwhich  a transaction value exists involved a sale of five hundred units, and it is recognized that the seller grants \nquantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's price list and using \nthat price applicable to a sale  of ten units.  This does not require that a sale had to have been made in quantities \nof ten as long as the price list has been established as being bona fide through sales at other quantities.  \n \n118.  Transaction value of similar goods. -  (1)  In applying sub-section (6) of section 25 of the Act \nthe appropriate officer shall, wherever possible, use a sale of similar goods at the same commercial level and in \nsubstantially the same quantities as the goods big valued.  For the purposes of sub -section (6) of th e said \nsection the transaction value of similar imported goods means the value of imported goods, adjusted as \nprovided for in sub -section (2) thereof which has already been accepted under sub -section (1) of that section.  \n \n(2) The provisions of Rule -117 sha ll, mutatis mutandis , also apply in respect of similar goods.  \n \n119.   Deductive value method. -  (1)  For the purposes of this rule, the expression \"unit price at \nwhich goods are sold in the greatest aggregate quantity\" means the price at which the greatest  number of units \nis sold in sales to persons who are not related to the persons from whom they buy such goods at the first \ncommercial level after importation at which such sale takes place.  \n \n Explanation. - (i)  When goods are sold on the basis of a printed  or advertised price list which grants \nfavourable unit prices for purchase made in larger quantities, the unit price at which goods are sold in the \ngreatest aggregate quantity shall be ascertained as per the following example: - \n \nSale quantity.   \n Unit price . Number of \nsales.  Total quantity sold at \neach price.  \nOne to ten units  100 10 sales of 5 \nunits  \n5 sales of 3 units.              65 \n \nEleven to twenty \nfive units  95 5 sales of 11 \nunits.              55 \n \nOver twenty five \nunits.  90  1 sale of 30 \nunits.  \n1 sale  of 50 \nunits.              80 \n \n      \n \n 436 \n  \n Note. - (i)   In this example, the greatest number of units sold at a price is eighty, therefore, the \nunit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is ninety.  \n(ii) In case when there are two separate sales.  For example, in the first sale five hundred units \nare sold at a price of ninety five currency units each.  In the second sale four hundred units \nare sold at a price of ninety currency units each.  In this example, as the greatest number of \nunits  sold at a particular pric e is five hundred, therefore, the unit price of the greatest \naggregate quantity shall be ninety -five. \n (iii) In case where various quantities are sold at various prices.  For example: - \n \n(1)  Sales:  \nSales Quantity  Unit Price.  \n(1) (2) \n   40 units      100 \n   30 units       90 \n   15 units      100 \n   50 units       95 \n   25 units      105 \n   35 units       90 \n   05 units      100 \n \n    Total quantity sold.              Unit price.  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------  \n   (1)     (2) \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n   65      90 \n   50      95 \n   60     100 \n   25     105 \n------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nNote.    In this example, the greatest number of units sold at a particular price is sixty -five, therefore, \nthe unit price in this greatest quantity is ninety.    \n \n (2) Any sal e in Pakistan, as provide in sub -rule (1), to a person who supplies directly or \nindirectly free of charge or at reduced  cost for use in connection with the production and sale for export of the \nimported goods any of the elements specified in clause (c) of  sub-rule (2) of section 25 of the Act shall not be \ntaken into account in establishing the unit price for the purposes of sub -section (7) of section 25 of the Act.  \n \n (3) For the purposes of the rules, the phrase \"profit and general expenses\" as used in sub -clause \n(i) of Clause (a) of sub -section (7) of section 25 of the Act, shall be taken as a whole for the purpose of \ndetermination of value.  The figure for the purposes of this deduction shall be determined on the basis of \ninformation supplied by or on beh alf of, the importer unless his figures are inconsistent with those obtained in \nsales in Pakistan, of the same class or kind of goods.  Where the importer's figures are inconsistent with such \nfigures, the amount for profit and general expenses may be based  upon relevant information other than that \nsupplied by, or on behalf of, the importer.  \n \n (4) Local taxes payable by reason of the sale of the goods for which a deduction is not made \nunder sub -clause (iv) of clause (a) of sub -section (7) of section 25 of th e Act shall be deducted under sub -\nclause (i) of clause (a) of that sub -section.  \n \n (5) In determining either the commissions of the usual profits and general expenses under clause \n(a) of sub -section (7) of section 25 of the Act, the question whether certain  goods are \"of the same class or \nkind\" as other goods must be determined on case to cases basis by reference to the  circumstances involved.  \nSales in Pakistan of the narrowest group or range of imported goods of the same class or kind, which includes \nthe goods being valued, for which necessary information can be provided, should be examined.  For the \n 437 \n  \n purposes of sub -section (7) of section 25 of the   Act\" goods of the same class or kind includes goods imported \nfrom the same country as the goods being value d as well as goods imported from other countries.  \n \n (6) For the purpose of clause (b) of sub -section (7) of section 25 of the Act, the \"earliest date\" \nshall be the date by which sales of the imported goods or of identical or similar goods are made in suffi cient \nquantity at the established  unit price.  \n \n (7) Wherever the method of Valuation provided in clause (c) of sub -section (7) of section 25 of \nthe Act is used, deductions made for the value added by further processing shall be based on objective and \nquan tifiable data relating tot he cost of such work.  Accepted industry formulas, recipes, methods of \nconstruction, and other industry practices would form the basis of the calculations.  \n \n (8) The method of valuation provided in clause (c) of sub -section (7) o f section 25 of the Act \nshall normally not be applicable when, as a result of  the further processing, the imported goods lose their \nidentity.  However, there can be instances where, although the identity of the imported  goods is lost, the value \nadded by the processing can be determined accurately without reasonable difficulty.  On the other hand, there \ncan also be instances where the imported goods maintain their identity but form such a minor element in the \ngoods sold in Pakistan that the use of this  va luation method would be unjustified.  Accordingly, each situation \nof this type must be considered on a case to case basis.  \n \n120.   Computed value method. -  (1)  As a general rule, customs -value shall be determined under \nsub-section (8) of section 25 of the  Act on the basis of  information readily available in Pakistan.  In order to \ndetermine a computed value, however, it may be necessary to examine the costs of  producing the goods being \nvalued and other information which has to be obtained from the country  of manufacture.  \n \n(2) For the purposes of this chapter, \"cost or value\" referred to in clause (a) of sub -section (8) of \nsection 25 of the Act shall be determined on the basis of information relating to the production of the goods \nbeing valued supplied by, or on behalf of, the producer.  It shall be based on the  commercial accounts of the \nproducer, provided that such accounts are consistent with the generally accepted accounting principles applied \nin the country where the goods are produced.  The \"cost of v alue\" shall include the cost of elements specified \nin sub -clauses (ii) and (iii) clause (b) of sub -section (2) of section 25 of the Act.  It shall also include the value, \napportioned as appropriate under rule 122 of any element specified in clause (c) of s ub-section (2) of section \n25 of the Act which has been supplied directly or indirectly by the buyer for the use in connection with \nproduction of the imported goods.  The value of the elements specified in sub -clause (iv) of clause (b) of sub -\nsection (2) of  section 25 of  the Act which are undertaken in Pakistan shall be included only to the extent that \nsuch elements are charged to the producer and no cost or  value of the elements referred to in this sub -section \nshall be counted twice in determining the com puted value.  \n \n(3) For the purposes of this chapter, the \"amount for profit and general expenses\" referred to \nclause (b) of sub -section (8) of section 25 of the Act  shall be determined on the basis of information supplied \nby or on behalf of the producer un less the producer's figures are inconsistent with  those usually reflected in \nsales of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by producers in the country \nof   manufacture for export to Pakistan.  \n \n(4) For the purposes of th is chapter , the \"amount for profit and general expenses\" referred to in \nclause (b) of sub -section (8) of section 25 of the Act  shall be taken as a whole.  If producer's profit figure is \nlow and the producer's general expenses are high, the producer's pro fit and general expenses, taken together, \nshall nevertheless be consistent with that usually reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind.  Where \nthe  producer can demonstrate a low profit on sales of the imported goods because of particular comme rcial \ncircumstances, the producer's  actual profit figures should be taken into account provided that the producer has \nvalid commercial reasons to justify them and the producer's  pricing policy reflects usual pricing policies in the \nbranch of industry con cerned.  Where the producer's own figures for profit and general  expenses are not \nconsistent with those usually reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued \nwhich are made  by the producers in the country of manufacture for export to Pakistan, the amount for profit \n 438 \n  \n and general expenses may be based upon relevant information other than that supplied by, or on behalf of, the \nproducer of the goods.  \n \n(5) Where information other than that supplied by, or on behalf of the produ cer is used for the \npurposes of determining a computed value, the appropriate officer shall inform the importer, if the latter so \nrequests, of the source of such information, the data used and the calculation based upon such data, subject to \nthe provisions  of rule 124.  \n \n(6) For the purposes of this chapter , the \"general expenses\" referred to in clause (b) of sub -\nsection (8) of section 25 of the Act, include the direct  and indirect costs of producing and selling the goods for \nexport which are not included under clause (a) of that sub -section.  \n \n(7) For the purposes of clause (b) of sub -section (8) of section 25 of the Act whether certain \ngoods are \"of the same class or kind\" as other goods,  must be determined on a case to case basis with \nreference to the ci rcumstances involved.  In determining the usual profits and general  expenses under sub -\nsection (8) of section 25 of the Act sales for export to Pakistan of the narrowest group or range of goods, which \nincludes the goods being valued, for which the necessa ry information can be provided, shall be examined.  For \nthe purposes of sub -section (8) of section  25 \"goods of the same class or kind\" must be from the same country \nas the goods being valued.  \n \n121.   Fall back method. -  (1)  Value of imported goods deter mined under sub -section (9) of section \n25 of the Act, shall, to the greatest extent possible be based on previously determined customs values of \nidentical goods assessed within ninety days.  \n \n(2)     The methods of valuation, to be employed under sub -sectio n (9) of section 25 of the Act may be \ninclusive of  those laid down in sub -sections (1), (5), (6), (7) and (8) of the said section, but a reasonable \nflexibility in the application of such methods would be in conformity with the aims and  provisions of sub -\nsection (9) of that section.  \n \n Explanation. -  Some examples of reasonable flexibility are as follows, namely: - \n \n (i) Identical goods -- \n \n(a) the requirement that the identical goods shall be imported at or about the same time \nas the goods being valued, cou ld be flexibly interpreted;   \n(b) identical imported goods produced in a country other than the country of \nexportation of the goods being valued could be the basis for customs valuation; and  \n(c) customs -values of identical imported goods already determined under sub -section \n(7) and (8) of section 25 could be used.  \n \n (ii) Similar goods -- \n \n(a) the requirement that the similar goods shall be imported at or about the same time as \nthe goods being valued could be flexibly interpreted;  \n(b) similar imported goods p roduced in a country other than the country of exportation \nof the goods being valued could be the basis  for customs valuation; and  \n(c) customs -values of similar imported goods already determined under sub -sections \n(7) and (8) of section 25 of the Act coul d be  used.  \n \n (iii) Deductive method -- \n \nThe requirement that the goods shall have been sold in the \"condition as imported\" as \nprovided in clause (a) of sub -section (7) of section 25  of the Act could be flexibly \ninterpreted, and the ninety days requiremen t could be administered flexibly.  \n \n 439 \n  \n 122.   Adjustment of value. -  (1)  For adjustment of value there shall be two factors involved in the \napportionment of the elements as specified in clause  (c) of sub -section (2) of section 25 of the Act to the \nimported g oods, namely: - \n \n  (i) the value of the element itself, and  \n(ii) the way in which that value is to be apportioned to the imported goods.  The \napportionment of these elements shall be made in a reasonable manner appropriate \nto the circumstances and in accord ance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples.  \n \n (2) The value of the elements shall be adjusted as follows, namely: - \n \n(i) if the importer acquired the element from a seller not related to him at a given cost, \nthe value of the element is that cost;  \n(ii) if the element was produced by the importer or by a person related to him, its value \nshall be the cost of producing it; and   \n(iii) if the element had been previously used by the importer, regardless of whether it \nhad been acquired or produced by such  i mporter, the original cost of acquisition or \nproduction would have to be adjusted downward to select its use in order to arrive at \nthe value of the element.  \n \n(3) Once a value has been determined for the element, it shall be apportioned to the value of the \nimported goods, as follows, namely: - \n \n(i) the value might be apportioned to the first shipment if the importer wishes to pay \nduty on the entire value at one time;  \n(ii) the importer may request that the value be apportioned over the number of units \nproduced  up to the time of the first shipment;  or \n(iii) the importer may request that the value be apportioned over the entire anticipated \nproduction where contract or firm commitments exist for that production.  \n \n Explanation. -  If an importer provides the produce r with a mould to be used in the production of the \nimported goods and contracts with him to buy ten  thousand units. By the time of arrival of the first shipment \nof one thousand units, the producer has already produced four thousand units.  The importer ma y request the \nappropriate officer to apportion the value of the mould over one thousand units, four thousand units or ten \nthousand units.  \n \n(4) Addition for the elements specified in sub -clause (iv) of clause (c) of sub -section (2) of \nsection 25 of the Act shall be based on objective and  quantifiable data.  In order to minimize the burden for \nboth the importer and appropriate officer in determining the values to be added, data  readily available in the \nbuyer's commercial record should be used in so far as p ossible.  \n  \n(5) For those elements supplied by the buyer which were purchased or leased by the buyer, the \naddition shall be made for the cost of the purchase  or the lease.  No addition shall be made for those elements \navailable in the public domain, other than the cost of obtaining copies of them.  \n \n(6) Payments made by the importer for the right to distribute or resell the imported goods shall \nnot be added to the price actually paid or payable  for the imported goods if such payments are not a condition \nof the sale for export of the goods to Pakistan.  \n \n(7) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be \nmade under clauses (b), (c), (d) and (e) of sub -section (2) of section 25 of the Act the transaction value can not \nbe determined under the provisions of sub -section (1) of section 25.  As an illustration of this, a royalty is paid \non the basis of the price in a sale in Pakistan of a liter of a particular product that was imported by weight in \nkilograms and made up into a solution after importation.  If the royalty is based partially on the imported goods \n 440 \n  \n and partially on other factors which have nothing to do with the imported goods, (such as when the imported \ngoods are mixed with domestic ingredients and are no lon ger separately identifiable, or when the royalty \ncannot be distinguished form special financial arrangements between the buyer and the seller), it would be \ninappropriate to attempt to make an addition for the royalty.  However, if the amount of this royalt y is based \nonly on the imported goods and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can \nbe made.  \n \nSUB -CHAPTER V  \n \n  MISCELLANEOUS  \n \n123.
