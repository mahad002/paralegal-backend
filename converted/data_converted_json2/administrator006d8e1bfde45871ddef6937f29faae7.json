Whatever may be the ill -feeling\nexisting between clients, it should not be allowed to influence advocates in their conduct and\ndemeano ur towards each other or toward the parties in the case. All personal clashes\nbetween advocates should be scrupulously avoided. In the trial of a cause it is indecent to\nallude to the personal history or the personal peculiarities and idiosyncrasies of adv ocates\nPakistan Legal Practitioners & Bar Councils Rules, 1976 107\nappearing on the other side. Personal colloquies between advocates which cause delay and\npromote unseemly wrangling should be carefully avoided.\n141. No division of fees with any person for legal services is proper except with\nanother advocate base d upon the principle of division of work as expressed in the\nagreement between the advocates.\n142. Subject to the precedence of the Attorney -General and the Advocate -General,\nas established by constitutional usage and practice, it is the duty of advocate t o maintain and\nuphold the order of precedence in accordance with the roll of advocates maintained by the\nBar Council.\n143. Junior and younger members should always be respectful to senior and elder\nmembers. The latter are expected to be not only courteous but also helpful to their junior and\nyounger brethren at the Bar.\n144. Where more than one advocate is engaged on any side it is the right of the\nsenior member to lead the case and the junior members should assist him, unless the senior\nso wants.\nB- Cond uct with regard to Clients:\n145. An Advocate shall not acquire an interest adverse to a client in the property or\ninterest involved in the case.\n146. An Advocate shall not accept employment adverse to a client or former client,\nrelating to a matter in refe rence to which he has obtained confidential information by reason\nof or in the course of his employment by such client or former client provided that an\nadvocate, who has not been formally engaged by a person and accepted a retainer nor\nreceived any fees f or such engagement is not precluded from accepting employment\nadverse to the interest of such person.\n147. An advocate shall not accept professional employment without first disclosing\nhis relation, if any, with the adverse party, and his interest, if any,  in the subject matter of\nsuch employment.\n148. An advocate  shall  not  represent  conflicting   interests.\n149. An advocate shall not himself or in benami purchase any property at a probate,\nforeclosure or judicial sale in an auction or proceeding in whi ch such advocate appears for a\nparty, nor shall he accept the whole or part of the property, in respect of which he had been\nengaged to conduct the case, in lieu of his remuneration, or as a reward or bounty.\n150. An advocate shall not commingle the proper ty of client with his own, and shall\npromptly report to the client the receipt by him of any money or other property belonging to\nsuch client.\nPakistan Legal Practitioners & Bar Councils Rules, 197 6 108\n151. An advocate shall not advise the commencement of prosecution or defence of\ncase, unless he has been consulte d in reference thereto, except when his relation to a party\nor to the subject matter is such as to make proper for him to do so.\n152. An advocate in his professional capacity shall not advise the violation of any\nlaw. This rule shall not apply to advice gi ven in good faith, that a law is inv alid.\n153. It is the right of an advocate to undertake the defen ce of a person accused of\ncrime, regardless of his personal opinion, as distinguished from knowledge as to the guilt of\nthe accused; otherwise innocent pers ons and victims merely of suspicious circumstances\nmight be denied proper defence. Having undertaken such defence, an advocate is bound by\nall fair and honourable means, to present every defence that the law of the land permits, to\nthe end that no person m ay be deprived of life or liberty, except by the process of law.\n154. In fixing fees, advocates should avoid charges which over -estimate their advice\nand services as well as those which undervalue them. A client's ability to pay cannot justify\ncharge in ex cess of the value of the service, though his property may justify a lesser charge,\nor even none at all. The reasonable requests of a brother advocate, should also receive\nspecial and kind consideration. In respect of widows and orphans of an advocate, all\nadvocates shall assist them free of charge.\nIn determining the amount of fee it is proper to consider; (i) the time and labour\nrequired, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the skill requisite properly to\nconduct the case; (ii) whether  the acceptance of employment in a particular case will\npreclude the Advocate's appearance for others in cases likely to arise out of the transaction,\nabout which there is a reasonable expectation that otherwise he would be employed, or will\ninvolve the lo ss of their business while employed in a particular case; (iii) the customary\ncharges of the Bar for similar service; (iv) the amount involved in the controversy and the\nbenefits resulting to the client from the service; (v) the contingency of the certaint y of the\ncompensation, and (vi) the character of the employment, whether casual or for an\nestablished and constant client. Of these considerations, none in itself is the controlling\nfactor. These are mere guidelines in ascertaining the real value of the se rvice.\nIn fixing fees it should never be forgotten that the profession is a branch of the\nadministration of justice and not a mere money making trade.\n155. Controversies with clients concerning compensation are to be avoided by the\nadvocate so far as shall  be compatible with his self -respect and with his right to receive\nreasonable recompense for his services. Any law suits with clients should be resorted to only\nto prevent injustice, imposition or fraud.\n156. Nothing operates, more certainly to create or f oster popular prejudice against\nadvocates as a class, and to deprive the profession of that full measures of public esteem\nand confidence which belongs to the proper discharge of its duties than does the false claim,\noften set up by the unscrupulous  in def ence or questionable transactions, that it is the duty\nof the advocate to do whatever may enable him to succeed in winning his client's cause.\nIt is improper for an advocate to assert in argument his personal belief in the client's\ninnocence or in the just ice of his cause. His professional duty is strictly limited to making\nsubmissions at the Bar consistently with the interest of his client.\nPakistan Legal Practitioners & Bar Councils Rules, 1976 109\nAn advocate owes entire devotion to the interests of the client, warm zeal in the\nmaintenance and defence of his righ ts and the exertion of his utmost learning and ability to\nthe end that nothing be taken or be withheld from him save by rules of law legally applied.\nNo fear of judicial disfavour or public unpopularity should restrain him from the full discharge\nof his du ty. In the judicial forum the client is entitled to the benefit of any and every remedy\nand defence that is authori zed by the law of the land, and he may expect his advocate to\nassert every such remedy or defence. But it is steadfastly to be borne in mind that the great\ntrust of the advocate is to be discharged within and not without the bounds of the law. The\noffice of an advocate does not permit, much less does it demand of him for any client, the\nviolation of any law or any manner of fraud or chicanery. In doing his professional duty to his\nclient he must obey the voice of his own conscience and not that of his client.\n157. When an advocate is a witness for his client except as to merely formal\nmatters, such as the attestation or custody of an instrument and the like, he should leave the\ntrial of the case to other advocates. Except when essential to the ends of justice, an\nadvocate should avoid testifying in Court on behalf of his client.\n158. In incidental matters, not effecting the merits of the cause in  a trial, nor working\nsubstantial prejudice to the rights of the client, such as forcing the opposite advocate to trial\nwhen he is under affliction or bereavement, forcing the trial on a particular day to the injury of\nthe opposite advocate when no harm wi ll result from a trial at a different time, agreeing to an\nextension of time for filing written statements, cross interrogatories and the like, the advocate\nmust be allowed to judge himself. In such matters no client has a right to demand that his\nadvocate  shall be ungenerous or that he does any thing therein repugnant to his own sense\nof honour and propriety .\nC- Duty to the Court:\n159. It is the duty of an advocate to maintain towards the Court a respectful attitude,\nnot for the sake of the temporary incu mbent of the judicial office, but for the maintenance of\nits supreme importance. Judges, not being wholly free to defend themselves, are peculiarly\nentitled to receive the support of the Bar against unjust criticism and clamor . At the same\ntime whenever th ere is proper ground for complaint against a judicial officer, it is the right\nand duty of an advocate to ventilate such grievances and seek redress thereof legally and to\nprotect the complainant and person affected.\n160. An advocate shall not advise a per son, whose testimony could establish or tend\nto establish a material fact, to avoid service of process, or conceal himself or otherwise to\nmake his testimony unavailable.\n161. An advocate shall not intentionally misquote to a judge, judicial officer or jur y\nthe testimony of a witness, the argument of the opposing advocate or the contents of a\ndocument; nor shall he intentionally misquote to a judge or judicial officer the language of a\nbook, statute or decision; nor shall he, with knowledge of its invalidit y and without disclosing\nsuch knowledge, cite as authority a decision that has been over -ruled or a statute that has\nbeen repealed or declared unconstitutional.\n162. Marked attention and unusual hospitality on the part of an advocate to a judge\nor judicial  officer not called for by the personal relations of the parties, subject both the judge\nand the advocate to misconstructions of motive and should be avoided. An advocate should\nnot communicate or argue privately with the judge as to the merits of a pendin g cause and\nhe deserves rebuke and denunciation for any advice or attempt to gain from a judge special\nPakistan Legal Practitioners & Bar Councils Rules, 197 6 110\nconsideration or favour. A self -respecting independence in the discharge of professional\nduty, without denial or diminution of the courtesy and respect d ue to the judge's station, is\nthe only proper foundation for cordial, personal and official relations between the Bench and\nthe Bar.\n163. The primary duty of an advocate engaged in public prosecution is not to\nconvict, but to see that justice is done. The suppression of facts or the concealing of\nwitnesses capable of establishing the innocence of the accused is highly reprehensible.\n164. Publications in newspaper by an advocate as to pending or anticipated litigation\nmay interfere with a fair trial in the c ourts and otherwise prejudice the due administration of\njustice. Generally they are to be condemned. If the extreme circumstances of a particular\ncase justify a statement or reference to the facts should not reach the public, it is\nunprofessional to make t hem anonymously. An ex -parte reference to the facts should not go\nbeyond quotation from the records and papers on file in the Court but even in extreme cases\nit is better to avoid any ex -parte statement.\n165. It is the duty of advocates to endeavour to pr event political considerations from\noutweighing judicial fitness in the appointment and selection of judges. They should protest\nearnestly and actively against the appointment or selection of persons who are unsuitable for\nthe Bench and thus should strive to have elevated thereto only those willing to forego other\nemployments, whether of a business, political or other character, which may embarrass their\nfree and fair consideration of the questions before them for the decision. The aspiration of\nadvocates f or judicial positions should be governed by an impartial estimate of their ability to\nadd honour to the office and not by a desire for the distinction the position may bring to\nthemselves.\n166. It is the duty of advocates to appear in Court when a matter i s called and if it is\nso possible to make satisfactory alternative arrangements.\n167. An advocate should in general refrain from volunteering his legal opinion or\naddressing any arguments in cases in which such advocate is not engaged unless called\nupon t o do so in open Court by a judge or judicial officer. In advancing any such opinion he\nmust do so with a sense of responsibility and impartiality without any regard to the interest of\nany party.\nD- Conduct with regard to the public generally:\n168. An advo cate shall not accept employment to prosecute or defend a case out of\nspite or for the purpose of harassing anyone or delaying any matter; nor shall he take or\nprosecute an appeal wilfully motivated to harass any one or delay any matter.\n169. An advocate s hould always treat adverse witnesses and parties with fairness\nand due consideration, and he should never minister to the malevolence of prejudices of a\nclient in the trial or conduct of a cause. The client cannot be made the keeper of the\nadvocate's consc ience in professional matters. He has no right to demand that his advocate\nshall abuse the opposite party or indulge in offensive arguments. Improper speech is not\nexcusable on the ground that it is what the client would say if speaking in his own behalf.\n170. An advocate must decline to conduct a civil cause or to make a defence when\nconvinced that it is intended merely to harass or to injure the opposite party or to work any\noppression  or wrong. But otherwise it is his right, and having accepted a retaine r, it becomes\nhis duty to insist upon the judgment of the Court as to the legal merits of his client's claim.\nPakistan Legal Practitioners & Bar Councils Rules, 1976 111\nHis appearance in Court should be deemed equivalent to an assertion on his honour that in\nhis opinion his client's case is one proper for judicial  determination.\n171. No advocate is obliged to act either as adviser or advocate for every person\nwho may wish to become his client. He has the right to decline professional employment.\nEvery advocate upon his own responsibility must decide what business h e will accept as an\nadvocate, what cause he will bring into Court for plaintiffs, and what cases he will contest in\nCourt for the defendants.\n172. No client, corporate or individual, however powerful, nor any cause civil or\npolitical, however important, is  entitled to receive, nor should any advocate render, any\nservice or advice involving disloyalty to the law whose ministers advocates are, or disrespect\nthe judicial office, which they are bound to uphold, or corruption of any person or persons\nexercising a public office or private trust, nor indulge in deception or betrayal of the public.\nWhen rendering any such improper service or advice the advocate invites and merits stern\nand just condemnation. Correspondingly, he advances the honour of his profession and the\nbest interest of his client when he renders service or gives advice tending to impress upon\nthe client and his undertaking exact compliance with the strictest principles of moral law. He\nmust also observe and advise his client to observe the statut e law; though until a statute\nshall have been finally construed and interpreted by competent adjudication, he is free and\nindeed is entitled to advise as to its validity and as to what he conscientiously believes to be\nits just meaning and extent. But abov e all, an advocate will find his highest honour in a\ndeserved reputation for fidelity to private trust and to public duty as an honest man and or a\npatriotic and loyal citizen.\n173. An advocate shall not communicate with, nor appear before a public officer ,\nboard, committee or body, in his professional capacity, without first disclosing that he is an\nadvocate representing interests that may be affected by the action of such officer, board,\ncommittee or body.\n174. An advocate should not accept employment as an advocate in any matter upon\nthe merits of which he has previously acted in a judicial capacity.\nAn advocate having once held public office or having been in the public\nemployment, should not, after his retirement accept employment in connection with any\nmatter which he has investigated or dealt with while in such office, nor employment except in\nsupport thereof.\n162[174-A. No Advocate will use his previous designation or post such as \"Retired\nJustice\", \"Ex Judge\", \"Retired General\", \"Ex Attorney -General\", \"Ex Advocate -General\" or\nuse any ex -designation, post or calling in any manner whatsoever, as prefix or suffix, either\non letter -heads, name plates, sign boards, visiting cards or in any form during the period of\nhis practice as an Advocate at any time.]\n162.Added  vide Notification published in the Gazette of Pakistan, Extra, (Part -II), December 31, 19 89.\nPakistan Legal Practitioners & Bar Councils Rules, 197 6 112\n163[174-B.
