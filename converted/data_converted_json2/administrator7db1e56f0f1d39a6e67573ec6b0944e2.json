Charge to state offence.__ Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with \nwhich the accused is charged.  \n(2) Specific name of offence sufficient description. If the law which creates the offence \ngives it any specific name, the offence may be described in the charge by that name only.  \n(3) How stated where offence has no specific name.  If the law which creates the offence \ndoes not give it any specific name, so much of the definition of the offence must be stated as to give \nthe accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.  \n(4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed \nshall be mentioned in the charge.  \n(5) What implied in charge.  The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement \nthat every legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the \nparticular case.  \n \n1Subs. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s.2 and Sch., for “he”.  \n2Subs. ibid.,  for “Magistrate”.  \n3Subs. ibid., for “himself”.  \n4Chapter XVIII was previously amended by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1923 (12 of 1923), s. 9, A.O., 1949, Sch., Code of Cr iminal Procedure  \n(Amdt.) Act, 1923 (18 of 1923), s. 57 and A.O, 1937.  \n*Sic. should read “its”. \n  \n \nPage 107 of 308 \n 1[(6) Language of charge.  The charge shall be written either in English or in the language of \nthe Court.]  \n(7) Previous conviction when to be set out.  If the accused 2[having been previously \nconvicted of any offence, is liable, by reason of such previous conviction, to enhanced punishment,  or \nto punishment of a different kind, for a subsequent offence, and it is intended to prove such previous \nconviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment which the Court may think fit to award for the \nsubsequent offence,] the fact, date and place of  the previous conviction shall be stated in the charge. If \nsuch statement 3[has been omitted,] the Court may add it at any time before sentence is passed.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a statement that A's act fell \nwithin the definition of murder given in sections 299 and 300 of the Pakistan Penal \nCode;  (XLV of 1860) that it did not fall within any of the general exceptions of the \nsame Code; and that it did   not fall within any of the five exceptions to section 300, or \nthat, if it did fall within Exception 1, one or other of the three provisos to that exception \napply to it.  \n(b) A is charged, under section 326 of the Pakistan Penal Code  (XLV of 1860 ), with \nvoluntarily causing grievous hurt to B by means of an instrument for shooting. This is \nequivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by section 335 of the \nPakistan Penal Code, and that the general exceptions did not apply to it.  \n(c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, adultery or criminal intimidation, or \nusing a false property­mark. The charge may state that A committed murder, or \ncheating, or theft, or extortion, or adultery, or criminal intimidation, or that he used  a \nfalse property­mark, without reference to the definitions of those crimes contained in \nthe Pakistan Penal Code  (XLV of 1860) ; but the sections under which the offence is \npunishable must, in each instance, be referred   to in the charge.  \n(d) A is charged, under section 184 of the Pakistan Penal Code ( XLV of 1860 ) with \nintentionally obstructing a sale of property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a \npublic servant. The charge should be in those words.  \n222. Particulars as to time Place and person.__ (1) The charge shall contain such \nparticulars as to the  time and place of the alleged offence, and the  person (if any) against  whom, or \nthe  thing (if any) in  respect of which, it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the \naccused notice of the matter with which  he is charged.  \n(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest \nmisappropriation of money, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum in respect of which the \noffence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates between which the offence is alleged to have \nbeen committed, without specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so framed shall be \ndeemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of section 234:  \nProvided that the time included between the first and last of such dates shall not exceed one \nyear.  \n \n1Subs. by A.O., 1949, Sch., for the Original sub­section (6).  \n2Subs. by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amdt.) Act, 1923 (18 of 1923) s. 61, for “has been previously convicted of any offence, and it is intended to \nprove such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment which the court is competent to award ”. \n3Subs. ibid., for “is omitted”.  \n \nPage 108 of 308 \n 223. When manner of committing offence must be stated.  When the nature of the case is \nsuch that the particulars mentioned in sections 221 and 222 do not give the accused sufficient notice \nof the matter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner   in \nwhich the allege d offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place. The charge need \nnot set out the manner in which the theft was effected.  \n(b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner \nin which A cheated B.  \n(c) A is accused of giving false evidence at a given time and place.  The charge must set \nout that portion of the evidence given by A which is alleged to be false.  \n(d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant, in the discharge of his public functions \nat a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which A obstructed B \nin the discharge of his functions.  \n(e) A is accused of the murder of B at a given time and place. The charge need not state \nthe manner in which A murdered B.  \n(f) A is accused of disobeying a direction of the law with intent to save B from punishment.  \nThe charge must set out the disobedience charged and the law infringed.  \n224. Words in charge taken in sense of law under which offence is punishable.  In every \ncharge words used in describing an offence shall be deemed to have been used in the sense attached to \nthem respectively by the law under which such offence is punishable.  \n225. Effect of errors.  No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be \nstated in the charge, and no omission to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded at any \nstage of the case as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such  error or omission, and it \nhas occasioned a failure of justice.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A is charged under section 242 of the Pakistan Penal Code, ( XLV of 1860 ), with \n\"having been in possession of counterfeit coin, having known at the time when he \nbecame possessed thereof that such coin was counterfeit,\" the  word  \"fraudulently\" \nbeing omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omis sion, \nthe error shall not be regarded as material.  \n(b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in \nthe charge, or is set out incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his \nown account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this that the omission to set \nout the manner of the cheating is not material.  \n(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in \nthe charge. There were many transactions between A and B, and A had no means of \nknowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no defence. The Court may \ninfer f rom such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the \n \nPage 109 of 308 \n case, a material error.  \n(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January 1882. In fact, the \nmurdered person's name was Haider Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th \nJanuary 1882. A was never charged with any murder but one, and had heard the 1[trial], \nwhich referred exclusively to the case of Haider Baksh.  The Court may infer from these \nfacts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.  \n(e) A was charged with murdering Haider Baksh on the 20th January 1882, and Kh oda \nBaksh (who tried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January 1882.  When \ncharged for the murder of Haider Baksh, he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh. \nThe witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haider Baksh. The \nCour t may infer from this that A was misled, and that the error was material.  \n2226. [Procedure on commitment without charge or with imperfect charge.]  [Omitted by the \nLaw Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (XIl of 1972), s. 2 and Sch. \n227. Court may alter charge.__ (1) Any Court may alter or add to any  charge  at  any  time \nbefore judgment is pronounced 3[* * * ]. \n(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.  \n228. When trial may proceed immediately after alteration.  If the charge framed or \nalteration or addition made under 4[* * * ] section 227 is such that proceeding immediately with the \ntrial is not likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor \nin the conduct of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such charge or alterat ion or addition \nhas been framed or made, proceed with the trial as if the new or altered charge had been the original \ncharge.  \n229. When new trial may be directed, or trial suspended.  If the new or altered or added \ncharge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to \nprejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a new trial or adjourn \nthe trial for such  period as may be necessary.  \n230. Stay of proceedings if prosecution of offence in altered charge require previous \nsanction .  If the offence stated in the new or altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of \nwhich previous sanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is \nobtained, unless sanction has been already obtained for a prosecu tion on the same facts as those on \nwhich the new or altered charge is founded.  \n231. Re­call of witnesses when charge altered.  Whenever a charge is altered or added to \nby the Court after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed to \nre­call or re­ summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness who may \nhave been e xamined, and also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.  \n232.

If the Court thinks it probable that A had such \nknowledge, and that he was misled in his defence by t he omission from the charge of the statement \nthat he had it, it shall direct a   new trial upon an amended charge; but, if it appears probable from the \nproceedings that A had no such knowledge, it shall quash the conviction.  \nJoinder of charges  \n233. Separate charges for distinct offences.  For every distinct offence of which any person \nis accused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately, except in \nthe cases mentioned in sections 234, 235, 236 and 239.  \nIllustration  \nA is accused of a theft on one occasion, and of causing grievous hurt on another occasion. A \nmust be separately charged and separately tried for the theft and causing grievous hurt.  \n234.
