Each life insurer is required to maintain an excess of admissible assets over liabilities, including \npolicyholder liabilities, of:  \n \n(a) a fixed amount as specified in Rule 1 4(1)(a); plus  \n \n(b) a solvency margin calculated in accordance with this Annexure, to be mai ntained as \nprescribed in Rule 1 4.  \n \n2. For statutory funds of life insurers set up under sub -section (5) of section 14 of the Ordinance in \nwhich accident and health business is written, the solvency margin as at any date would be \ncalculated as the hi gher of:  \n \n(a) 20% of earned premium revenue in the preceding twelve months, net of reinsurance \nexpense subject to a maximum deduction for reinsurance of 50% of the gross figure; or  \n \n(b) 20% of sum of liability for unexpired risk and its liability for outstanding  claims, net of \nreinsurance subject to a maximum deduction for reinsurance in each case of 50% of the gross \nfigure.  \n \n3. For other statutory funds the solvency margin shall be calculated by carrying out two exercises as \nunder, and to take the higher of the two figures:  \n \n(a) Determination of the solvency margin to be maintained in each Statutory Fund on the basis \nas provided in paragraphs 5 to 9 below; and  \n \n(b) Requiring the appointed actuary to determine the policyholder liabilities on certain scenarios \nto be specified by the Commission through circular, with the margin being determined as the \nhighest excess of the liabilities d etermined in any of the scenarios over those displayed in the \nfinancial statements.  \n \n4. The Commission shall specify through circular the scenarios mentioned in paragraph 3(b) above \nafter consulting the Pakistan Society of Actuaries. Till the scenarios ar e prescribed only the first \ncalculation shall be carried out.  \n \n5. The first calculation of the solvency margin for each Statutory Fund for business other than \nAccident and Health business would be determined in two parts (the margin being the sum of the \ntwo parts):  \n \n(a) A proportion of the policyholder liabilities determined by the Appointed Actuary, such \nproportion being referred to below as the “First Factor”; and  \n \n(b) A proportion of the Sum at Risk, such proportion being referred to below as the “Second \nFacto r”.  \n \nPage 150 of 177 \n 6. The First and Second factors will depend upon the nature of underlying policies and will be as per \nAttachment 1 to this Annexure.  \n \n7. The first part for each line of business will be calculated as follows:  \n \nK1 x Policyholder Liabilities before Reinsurance x First Factor (per Attachment 1)  \n \nwhere K1= 0.85* or (Mathematical Reserves after Reinsurance/ Mathematical Reserves \nbefore Reinsurance), whichever is higher. [* 0.50 in case of reinsurers, carrying on life \ninsurance -business].  \n \n8. The second  part for each line of business will be calculated as follows:  \n \nK2 x Total Sum at Risk before Reinsurance x Second Factor (per Attachment 1)  \n \nwhere K2= 0.5 or (Sum at Risk after reinsurance/Sum at risk before reinsurance), whichever \nis higher; where the Su m at Risk for an individual policy is negative it is to be ignored.  \n \n9. The solvency margins mentioned in paragraphs 5 to 8 shall be partially applicable until 31 \nDecember 2014, in that life insurers will be required to maintain at least the following prop ortion of \nthe margins calculated:  \n \nAs on 31 December 2012  33%  \nAs on 31 December 2013  67%  \nAs on 31 December 2014  100%  \n \nThe calculations set out in paragraphs 2 to 9 above shall be carried out for each statutory fund \nseparately and shall be supported by a statement to be prepared in accordance with the form given \nin Attachment 2, such Attachment requiring to be submitted as a part of each Financial Condition \nReport being submitted under section 50 of the Ordinance. In case a life insurer appl ies for and is \ngranted permission by the Commission to maintain the solvency margin in its shareholders’ fund and \nstatutory funds in aggregate (rather than within each statutory fund), than the statutory margin to be \nmaintained in the shareholders’ fund an d statutory funds in aggregate shall be the aggregate of the \nmargin calculated for each statutory fund separately, and shall be in addition to the fixed amount \nprescribed under Rule 1 4 (1)(a).  \n  \nPage 151 of 177 \n Attachment 1 to Annexure III  \n \nFACTORS FOR DETERMINATION OF SOLVENCY MARGIN FOR LIFE INSURERS  \n \n \nCode  Type of \nBusiness  Policy Types with Examples  Factor 1  Factor 2  \nLife Risk  Other  \n0 Non -Linked Individual Life Business  \n    \n01 Conventional \nnon-linked \npolicies  Includes both risk products (term assurances, \ndecreasing term assurances, family income \nbenefit, accident and disability riders [other \nthan those written in a statutory fund in which \nonly accident & health business is written] \nincluding waiver of premiums, and savings \nproducts (endowment assurances \n(participating and non -participat ing), whole \nlife policies, etc. ).

Valuation Parameters (applicable to clauses 4 & 5) — (1) The valuation parameters shall \nconstitute the bases on which actuarial reserves have to be computed.  \n \n(2) Mortality rates to be used shall be in accordance with the table of mortality rates prescribed by \nthe Pakistan Society of Actuaries.  \n \n(3) Morbidity rates to be used shall be by reference to a table, the use of which can be justified by \nthe appointed ac tuary.  \n \n(4) Valuation rates of interest , to be used by appointed actuary, subject to the following, shall be an \neffective rate of 3.75% per annum.  \n \n(a) this rate shall be subject to review by the Pakistan Society of Actuaries from time to time; \nand  \n \n(b) other p arameters , may be taken into account, depending on the type of policy. In \nestablishing the values of such parameters, the considerations set out in this Annexure shall \nbe taken into account.  \n \n7.
