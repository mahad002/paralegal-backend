He attains  \nmajority four years after such accruer. He may institute his suit at any time within  \nthree  years from the date  of his  attaining  majority . \n \n(b) A right to sue accrues to Z during his minority. After the accruer, but while Z is still a  \nminor, h e becomes insane. Time runs against Z from the date when his insanity and  \nminority  cease.  \n \n(c) A right  to sue accrues  to X during  his minority.  X dies before  attaining  majority,  and \nis succeed by Y, his minor son. Time runs against Y from the date of his attaining  \nmajority.  \n \n1Ins. by the Limitation  (Amdt.)  Ordinance,  1962  (43 of 1962),  s. 2. \n2Subs.  by the Indian  Limitation  (Amdt.)

I. p. 258. \n4lns. by Ord. 43 of  1962, s.  3. \nPage  6 of 47  \n7. Disability of one of several plaintiffs or applicants. Where one of several persons  \njointly entitled to institute a suit 1[or proceeding] or make an application for the execution of a decree  \nis under any such disability, and a discharge can be given without the concurrence of such person,  \ntime will run against them all: but, where no such  discharge can be given, time will not run as against  \nany of them until one of them becomes capable of giving such discharge without the concurrence of  \nthe others or  until the  disability  has ceased.  \n \nIllustrations  \n(a) A incurs a debt to a firm of which B, C an d D are partners. B is insane, and C is a  \nminor. D can give a discharge of the debt without the concurrence or B and C. Time  \nruns against B, C and  D. \n \n(b) A incurs  a debt to a firm of which  E, F and G are partners.  E and F are insane,  and G \nis a minor.

A has, under the ordinary law, only one year  \nremaining within which to sue. But under section 6 and this section an extension of  \ntwo years will be allowed him, making in all a period of three years from the date o f \nhis attaining  majority,  within which he  may bring  his suit.  \n \n(b) A right to sue for an hereditary office accrues to A who at the time is insane. Six years  \nafter the accruer A recovers his reason. A has six years, under the ordinary law, from  \nthe date when his insanity ceased within which to institute a suit. No extension of time  \nwill be given him under  section 6 read  with this section.  \n \n(c) A right to sue as landlord to recover possession from a tenant accrues to A, who is an  \nidiot. A dies three years after the  accruer, his idiocy continuing up to the date of his  \ndeath. A’s representative in interest has, under the ordinary law, nine years from the  \ndate of A’s death  within  which  to bring  a suit. Section  6 read with this section  does \nnot extend that time, except where the representative is himself under disability when  \nthe representation devolves upon him.  \n \n \n \n \n1Ins. by the Limitation  (Amdt.)  Ordinance,  1962  (43 of 1962),  s. 3. \n2 Ins. by the Indian  Limitation  (Amdt.)  Act, 1929 (1  of 1929),s.2.  \nPage  7 of 47  \n \n9. Continuous running of time. Where once time has begun to run, no subsequent dis - \nability  or inability  to sue  stops it :  \n \nProvided that where letters of administration to the estate of a creditor have been granted to  \nhis debtor, the running of the time pres cribed for a suit to recover the debt shall be suspended while  \nthe administration continues.  \n \n10. Suits against express trustees and their representatives.

Nothing  is an interruption  within  the meaning  of this section,  unless  where  \nthere is an actual discontinuance of the possession or enjoyment by reason  of an obstruction by the  \nact of some person other than the claimant, and unle ss such obstruction is submitted to or acquiesced  \nin for one year after the claimant has notice thereof and of the person making or authorizing the same  \nto be made.  \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A suit is brought in 1911 for obstructing a right of way. The defendant admits  \nthe obstruction, but denies the right of way. The plaintiff proves that the right  \nwas peaceably  and openly  enjoyed  by him, claiming  title thereto  as an \neasement and as of right, without interruption from 1st January 1890 to 1st  \nJanuary  1910. The  plaintiff  is entitled to judgment.  \n \n(b) In a like suit the plaintiff shows that the right  was peaceably and openly  \nenjoyed by him for twenty years. The defendant proves that the plaintiff, on  \none occasion during the twenty years, had asked his leave to enjoy the right.  \nThe suit shall be  dismissed.  \n \n27. Exclusion in favour of reversioner of Servient tenement. Where any land or water  \nupon,  over or from  which  any easement  has been  enjoyed  or derived  has been  held under  or by \nvirtue of any interest for life or any term of  years exceeding three years from the granting thereof, the  \ntime of the enjoyment of such easement during the continuance of such interest or term shall be  \nexcluded  in the computation  of the period  of twenty  years  in case the claim  is, within  three  years  \nnext after the determination  of such interest  or term,  resisted  by the person  entitled,  on such \ndetermination,  to the  said land or  water.  \nIllustration  \nA sues for a declaration that he is entitled to a right of way over B’s land. A proves that he  \nhas enjoye d the right for twenty -five years; but B shows that during ten of these years C,  Hindu  \nwidow, had a life interest in the land, that on C’s death B became entitled to the land, and that within  \ntwo years after C’s death he contested A’s claim to the right. T he suit must be dismissed, as A, with  \nreference  to the  provisions of this section, has  only proved enjoyment  for fifteen  years.  \n \n228. * * * * * * * \n \nPART V  \nSAVINGS  AND  REPEALS  \n29.
