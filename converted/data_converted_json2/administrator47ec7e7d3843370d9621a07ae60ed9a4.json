Right to protection :___ (1) The right to layout design protection shall be available under this \nOrdinance if and to the extent, the layout -design is original within the meaning of section 3 and has \nbeen subject of application for registration.  \n (2)    The right to layout -design protection shall belong to the creator of the layout -design. \nWhere several persons have jointly created a layout -design, then such right shall belong to them jointly.  \n (3) Where the layout -design has been created in execution of commission or an employment  \ncontract, the right to layout design protection shall belong, in the absence of contractual provisions to \nthe contrary, to the person who commissioned the work or to the employee.  \n (4)    The right to layout -design protection shall be assignable or transf erable by succession.  \n (5)    The right to layout -design protection shall not depend upon whether or not the integrated \ncircuit which incorporates the registered layout -design is itself incorporated in an article.  \n 5. Effect of  protection :___(1) Subject to  section 17, the protection shall have the effect that the \nfollowing acts shall be unlawful if performed without the authorization of the right -holder, namely: —  \n \nPage 5 of 10 \n (i)  reproducing, whether by incorporation in an integrated circuit or otherwise, the \nregister ed layout -design in its entirety or any part thereof, except the act of \nreproducing any part that does not comply with the requirement of originality \nreferred to in section 3; and  \n \n(ii)  importing, selling or otherwise distributing for com mercial purpose the \nregistered layout -design, or an integrated circuit in which the registered layout -\ndesign is incorporated or an article incorporating such an integrated circuit in so \nfar as it continues to contain an unlawfully reproduced layout -design.  \n (2)    The fol lowing acts shall not require the authorization of the right holder, namely: — \n \n(i)   reproduction of the registered layout -designs for private purposes or for the sole \npurpose of evaluation, analysis, research or teaching  \n \n(ii)  the incorporation in an int egrated circuit of a layout -design created on the basis \nof such analysis or evaluation and which is itself original under section 3 or the \nperformance of any of the acts referred to in sub -section (1) in respect of that \nlayout -design;  \n \n(iii)   the perform ance of any of the acts referred to in clause (ii) of sub -section (1) \nwhere the act is performed in respect of a registered layout -design, or in respect \nof an integrated circuit in which such a layout design is incorporated, that has \nbeen put on the market  by or with the consent of, the right holder;  \n \n(iv)  the performance of any of the acts referred to in clause (ii) of sub -section (1) in \nrespect of an integrated circuit incorporating an unlawfully reproduced layout -\ndesign or any article incorporating such  an integrated circuit where the person \nperforming or ordering such an act did not know, when acquiring the integrated \ncircuit or the article incorporating such an integrated circuit, that it incorporated \nan unlawfully reproduced layout -design. However, af ter the time that such \nperson has received sufficient notice that the layout -design was unlawfully \nreproduced that person may perform any of the said acts only with respect to \nthe stock on hand, or ordered before such time, and shall be liable to pay to th e \nright holder a sum equivalent to a reasonable royalty such as would be payable \nunder a freely negotiated licence in respect of such a layout -design; or  \n \n(v)   the performance of any of the acts referred to in clause (ii) of sub -section (1) \nwhere the act is performed in respect of an identical layout -design which is \noriginal and has been created independently by a third party.  \n 6.
