Such behavior is also a part of \nthe harassment.  \n(iii) an informal approach to resolve a complaint of harassment may be through mediation \nbetween the part ies involved and by providing advice and counseling on a strictly \nconfidential basis ; \n(iv)  a complainant or a staff member designated by the complainant for the purpose may \nreport an incident of harassment informally to her supervisor, or a member of the \nInquiry Committee, in which case the supervisor or the Committee member may \naddress the issue at her discretion in the spirit of this Code. The request may be made \norally or in writing;  \n(v)  if the case is taken up for investigation at an informal level, a  senior manager from the \noffice or the head office will conduct the investigation in a confidential manner. The \nalleged accused will be approached with the intention of resolving the matter in a \nconfidential manner;   \n(vi)  if the incident or the case repor ted does constitute harassment of a higher degree and \nthe officer or a member reviewing the case feels that it needs to be pursued formally \nfor a disciplinary action, with the consent of the complainant, the case can be taken as \na formal complaint;  \n(vii)  a complainant does not necessarily have to take a complaint of harassment through \nthe informal channel. She can launch a formal complaint at any time;  \n(viii) the complainant may make formal complaint through her in charge, su pervisor, CBA \nnominee or worker’ s representative, as the case may be, or directly to any member of \nthe Inquiry Committee. The Committee member approached is obligated to initiate \nthe process of investigation. The supervisor shall facilitate the process and is \nobligated not to cover up or  obstruct the inquiry;  \n(ix)  assistance in the inquiry procedure can be sought from any member of the \norganization who should be contacted to assist in such a case;  \n(x) the employer shall do its best to temporarily make adjustments so that the accused and \nthe complainant do not have to interact for official purposes during the investigation \nperiod. This would include temporarily changing the office, in case both sit in one \noffice, or taking away any extra charge over and above their contract which may give \none party excessive powers over the other’ s job conditions. The employer can also \n \nPage 12 of 12 \n decide to send the accused on leave, or suspend the accused in accordance with the \napplicable procedures for dealing with the cases of misconduct, if required:  \n(xi)  retaliat ion from either party should be strictly monitored. During the process of the \ninvestigation work, evaluation, daily duties, reporting structure and any parallel \ninquiries initiated should be strictly monitored to avoid any retaliation from either \nside.1[Filing counter -blast suits for defamation etc. are  also retaliation. The \nOmbudsperson  or Inquiry Committee, as the case may be, should take notice of this in  \nhis or  its proceedings.]  \n(xii)  the harassment usually occurs between  colleagues when they are alon e, therefore \nusually it is difficult to produce evidence. It is strongly recommended that staff should \nreport an offensive behavior immediately  to someone they trust, even if they do not \nwish to make a formal complaint at the time. Although not reporting i mmediately \nshall not affect the merits of the case; and  \n(xiii)  the Code lays down the minimum standards of behavior regarding protection of \nwomen from harassment at workplace etc. but will not affect any better arrangement \nthat an organization may have de veloped nor will it bar the grant of protection that \nemployees working in an institute may secure from their employers through \nnegotiation.  \n \n \n___________  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1Added by Protection against Harassment of women at the Workplace (Amendment) Act, 2022 (V of 2022) , s. 7"
