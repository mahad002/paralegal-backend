Words referring to acts include illegal omissions.

The word ―act‖ denotes as well a series of acts as a single act : the word \n―omission‖ denotes as well a series of omissions as a single  omission.  \n \n1[34. Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention. When a criminal act \nis done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is \nliable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.]  \n \n35. When such an act is criminal by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge of \nintention. Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being d one with a criminal \nknowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with \nsuch knowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him \nalone with that knowledge or intention.  \n \n36. Effect caused partly by act and partly by omission. Wherever the causing of a certain \neffect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be \nunderstood that the causing of that effect partly by an ac t and partly by an omission is the same \noffence.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA intentionally causes Z‘s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly by \nbeating Z. A has committed murder.  \n \n37. Co­operation by doing one of several acts constituting an offence. When an offence is \ncommitted by means of several acts, whoever intentionally co­operates in the commission of that \noffence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that \noffence.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of \npoison.  A and B administer  the poison  according  to the agreement  with intent  to murder  \nZ. Z dies from the effects of the several doses of poison so administered to him. Here A \nand B intentionally co­operate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an \nact by which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though the ir acts are \nseparate.  \n \n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such, have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternately for six \nhours at a time. A and B, intending to cause Z's death, knowingly co­operate in causing \nthat effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with \nfood supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the \nmurder of  Z. \n \n1Subs. by the Indian Penal Code Amdt. Act, 1870 (27 of 1870), s. 1, for the original section.  \nPage 30 of 178   (c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A intending to cause Z's death, illegally omits to \nsupply Z with food ; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the \nstarvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his office, and B \nsucceeds him. B, without collusion or co­operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z  \nwith food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z's death. Z dies of hunger. B is \nguilty of murder, but, as A did not co­operate with B, A is guilty only of an attempt to \ncommit  murder.  \n \n38. Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences. Where several \npersons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different \noffences by means of that  act. \n \nIllustration  \n \nA attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only \nculpable homicide not amounting to murder. B having ill­will towards Z and intending to kill him, and \nnot having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both \nengaged in causing Z‘s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide.  \n \n39. ―Voluntarily‖. A person is said to cause an effect ―voluntaril y‖ when he causes it by means \nwhereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those means, he knew \nor had reason to believe to be likely to cause  it. \n \nIllustration  \n \nA sets fire, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of facilitating robbery \nand thus causes the death of a person. Here, A may not have intended to cause death, and may even \nbe sorry that death has been caused by his act : yet, if he knew that he was likely to cause death, he \nhas cause d death  voluntarily.  \n \n1[40. ―Offence.‖ Except in the 2[chapters] and sections mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of this \nsection, the word \"offence\" denotes a thing made punishable by this Code.  \n \nIn Chapter IV, 3[Chapter VA] and in the following sections, namely , sections 4[64,] 4[65,] 4[66,] \n5[67,] 4[71,] 109, 1l0, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 187, 194, 195, 203, 211, 213, 214, 221, 222, 223, 224,  \n225, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 347, 348, 388, 389, and 445, the word \"offence\" denotes a thing \npunishable under this Code , or under any special or local law as hereinafter defined.  \n \nAnd in sections 141, 176, 177, 201, 202, 212, 216 and 441 the word \"offence\" has the same \nmeaning when the thing punishable under the special or local law is punishable under such law with \nimpris onment for a term of six months or upwards, whether with or without fine.]  \n \nlSubs. by the Indian Penal Code Amdt.

Description of imprisonment for non­payment of fine. The imprisonment which the Court \nimposes in default of payment of a fine may be of any description to which the offender might have \nbeen sentenced for the  offence.  \n \n67. Imprisonment for non­payment of fine, when offence punishable with fine only. If the \noffence be punishable with fine only, 1[the imprisonment which the Court imposes in default of \npayment of the fine shall be simple, and] the term for which the Court directs the offender to be \nimprisoned, in default of payment of fine, shall not exceed the following scale, that is to say, for any \nterm not exceeding two months when the amount of the fine shall not exceed fifty rupees, and for any \nterm not exceeding four months when the amount shall not exceed o ne hundred rupees, and for any \nterm not exceeding six months in any other  case.  \n \n68. Imprisonment to terminate on payment of fine. The imprisonment which is imposed in \ndefault of payment of a fine shall terminate whenever that time is either paid or levied by process of \nlaw. \n \n69. Termination of imprisonment on payment of proportional part of fine. If, before the \nexpiration of the term of imprisonment fixed in default of payment, such a proportion of the fine be \npaid or levied that the term of imprisonment suffered in default of payment is not less than \nproportional to the part of the fine still unpaid, the imprisonment shall  terminate.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA is sentenced to a fine of one hundred rupees and to four months'  imprisonment in default of \npayment. Here, if seventy­five rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one month \nof the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the first month has expired. If seventy­five \nrupees be paid or levied at  the time of the expiration of the first month, or at any later time while A \ncontinues in imprisonment, A will be immediately discharged. If fifty rupees of the fine be paid or \nlevied before the expiration of two months of the imprisonments, A will be disc harged as soon as the \ntwo months are completed. If fifty rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration to those two \nmonths, or at any later time while A continues in imprisonment, A will be immediately discharged.  \n \n70. Fine leviable within six years, or during imprisonment. Death not to discharge property \nfrom liability. The fine, or any part thereof which remains unpaid, may be levied at any time within \nsix years after the passing of the sentence, and if, under the sentence, the offender be liable to impri­ \nsonment for a longer period than six years, then at any time previous to the expiration of that period ; \nand the death of the offender does not discharge from the liability any property which would, after his \ndeath, be legally liable for his debts.  \n \n71. Limit of punishment of offence made up of several offences. Where anything which is an \noffence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished \nwith the punishment of more than one of such his offences, unle ss it be so expressly  provided.  \n \n2[Where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force \nfor the time being by which offences are defined or punished, or  \n \n1Ins. by the Indian Penal Code Amdt.

Here A may have committed the offence of \nvoluntarily causing hur t to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which \nmake up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be \nimprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for \nthe whole  beating. \n \n(b) But if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow \ngiven to Y is no part of the act whereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one \npunishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow given to Y. \n \n72. Punishment of person guilty of one of several offences, the judgment stating that it is \ndoubtful of which. In all cases in which judgment is given that a person is guilty of one of several \noffences specified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences he is guilty, the \noffender shall be punished for the offence for which the lowest punishment is provided if the same \npunishment is not provided for  all. \n \n73. Solitary confinement. Whenever any person  is convicted of an offence for which under this \nCode the Court has power to sentence him to rigorous imprisonment, the Court may, by its sentence, \norder that the offender shall be kept in solitary confinement for any portion or portions of the \nimprisonmen t to which he is sentenced, not exceeding three months in the whole, according to  the \nfollowing scale, that is to say  \n \na time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months :  \n \na time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months and  \n1[shall not exceed one] year :  \na time not exceeding three months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed one year.  \n \n74. Limit of solitary confinement. In executing a sente nce of solitary confinement, such \nconfinement shall in no case exceed fourteen days at a time, with intervals between the period of \nsolitary confinement of not less duration than such periods, and when the imprisonment awarded shall \nexceed three months, th e solitary confinement shall not exceed seven days in any one month of the \nwhole imprisonment awarded, with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not less \nduration than such  periods.  \n \n1Subs. by the Indian Penal Code Amdt.

Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound, by law. \nNothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not \nby reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bou nd by law to do  it. \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A, a soldier, fires on a mob by the order of his superior officer, in conformity with the \ncommands of the law.

A has committed no  offence.  \n \n77. Act of Judge when acting judicially. Nothing is an offence which is done by a Judge when \nacting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given \nto him by law. \n \n78. Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court. Nothing which is done in pursuance \nof, or which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court of Justice, if done whilst such judgment \nor order remains in force, is an offence, notwithstanding the Court may have had no jurisdiction to \npass such judgment or order, provided the person doing the act in good faith believes that the Court \nhad such  jurisdiction.  \n \n1Subs. by the Indian Penal Code Amdt.

Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified, by law. \nNothing is an offence which is done by any per son who is justified by law, or who by reason of a \nmistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by \nlaw, in doing  it. \n \nIllustration  \n \nA sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment, \nexerted in good faith of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murders in the \nact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper authorities. A has committed no offence, though it \nmay turn  out that Z was acting in self­defence.  \n \n80. Accident in doing a lawful act. Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or \nmisfortune, and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful \nmanner by lawful means and with proper care and  caution.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA is at work with a hatchet ; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here if there \nwas no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an  offence.  \n \n81. Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm. \nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause \nharm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith fo r the purpose of \npreventing or avoiding other harm to person or  property.  \n \nExplanation.  It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or  avoided  \nwas of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the \nknowledge that it was likely to cause harm.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, \nfinds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run \ndown a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course of \nhis vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C \nwith only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his \ncourse without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of \navoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though \nhe may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that \neffect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was \nsuch as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down  C. \n \n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. \nHe does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it \nbe found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nat ure and so imminent as to  \nexcuse A‘s act, A is not guilty of the  offence.  \n \nPage 39 of 178   82. Act of child under seven years of age. Nothing  is an offence which is done by a child under  \n1[ten] years of age .  \n83. Act of a child above seven and under twelve of immature understanding. Nothing is an \noffence which is done by a child above 1[ten] years of age and under 1[fourteen], who has not \nattained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his condu ct \non that  occasion.  \n \n84. Act of a person of unsound mind. Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at \nthe time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, \nor that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to  law. \n \n85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of in toxication caused against his will. \nNothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of \nintoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or \ncontrary to law: provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his \nknowledge or against his  will. \n \n86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is \nintoxicated. In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or \nintent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had \nthe same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which \nintoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his  will. \n \n87. Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done. by \nconsent. Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by \nthe doer to be likely to cause death, or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it \nmay cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has \ngiven consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm ; or by reason of any harm which it \nmay be known by the doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk \nof that  harm.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of \neach to suffer any harm which in the course of such fencing, may be caus ed without foul play; and if \nA, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.  \n \n88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person’s benefit. \nNothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may \ncause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any \nperson for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or \nimplied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that  harm.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers \nunder the painful complaint, but not intending to cause Z‘s death, and intending, in good faith Z‘s \nbenefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z‘s consent. A has committed no offence.  \n \n1Subs. by Act X of 2016, s. 2 and 3.  \nPage 40 of 178   89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of \nguardian. Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, \nor of unsound mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person \nhaving lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be \nintended by the doer to cause or be known by t he doer to be likely to cause to that person  : \n \nProvisos . Provided — \n \nFirst.  That this exception  shall  not extend  to the intentional  causing  of  death,  or to the \nattempting to cause death ;  \n \nSecondly.  That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing  it \nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous  \nhurt; or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity  ; \n \nThirdly.  That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing  of grievous hurt, or to the  \nattempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or \nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity ;  \n \nFourthly . That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the  committing  \nof which offence it would not extend.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA, in good faith, for his child‘s benefit without his child‘s consent, has his child cut for the stone \nby a surgeon, knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the child‘s death, but not intending \nto cause the child‘s death. A is within the exception, inasmuch as his object was the cure of the  child.  \n \n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception. A consent is not such a consent \nas is intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or \nunder a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has r eason to believe, that \nthe consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception ;  or \n \nConsent of insane person . if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or \nintoxication,is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent  \n; or \n \nConsent of child. unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a  \nperson who is under twelve years of  age. \n \n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm caused. The exceptions in \nsections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which \nthey may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the \nconsent, or on whose behalf the consent is given. \n \nPage 41 of 178   Illustration  \n \nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) \nis an offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. \nTherefore, it is n ot an offence ―by reason of such harm‖ , and the consent of the woman or of her \nguardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act.  \n \n92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent. Nothing is an offence by \nreason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even \nwithout that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to \nsignify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in \nlawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with \nbenefit  : \n \nProviso. Provided — \n \nFirst.  That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or the  attempting  \nto cause death;  \n \nSecondly.   \n \nThat this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing  \nit knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous \nhurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity ;  \n \nThirdly.  That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to  the \nattempt ing to cause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt ;  \n \nFourthly.  That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to  the \ncommitting of which offence it would not extend.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be \ntrepanned. A not intending Z‘s death but in good faith for Z‘s benefit, performs the trepan \nbefore Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed no  offence.  \n \n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill \nZ, but not intending to kill Z, and in good faith intending Z‘s benefit. A‘s ball gives Z a \nmortal wound. A has committed no  offence.  \n \n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an \noperation be immediately performed. There is not time to apply to the child‘s guardian. A \nperforms the operation inspite of the entreaties of the child, intending in good faith, the \nchild's benefit.  A has committed no  offence.  \n \n(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops \nthe child from the housetop, knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not \nintending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child‘s benefit. Here even if  \nthe child is killed by the fall, A has committed no  offence.  \n \nPage 42 of 178    \n92. Explanation . Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and  \n \n93. Communication made in good faith. No communication made in good faith is an offence by \nreason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that  person.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient \ndies in consequence of the shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the \ncommunication might cause the patient‘s death.  \n \n94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats. Except murder, and offences against the \nState punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do \nit by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to \nthat person will otherwise be the consequence : Provided the person doing the act did not of his own \naccord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, p lace himself in  \nthe situation by which he became subject to such  constraint.  \n \nExplanation  1. A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being  beaten, joins  \na gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the \nground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law.  \n \nExplanation  2. A person  seized  by a gang  of dacoits,  and forced  by threat  of instant  death,  to \ndo a thing which is an offence by law ; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force \nthe door of a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception.  \n \n95. Act caus ing slight harm. Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended \nto cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of \nordinary sense and temper would complain of such  harm.  \n \nOf the Right of Private Defence  \n \n96. Things done in private defence. Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the \nright of private  defence.  \n \n97. Right of private defence of the body and of property. Every person has a right, subject to \nthe restrictions contained in section 99, to  defend  \n \nFirst . \nbody ;  His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human  \n \nSecondly . The property, whether moveable or immoveable, of himself or of any other  person,  \nagainst any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal \ntrespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or cri minal trespass.  \nPage 43 of 178   98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc. When an act, \nwhich would otherwise be a certain offence is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of \nmaturity of understanding, the unsou ndness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, \nor by reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of \nprivate defence against that act which he would have if the act were that  offence.  \n \nIllustrati ons \n \n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A ; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has \nthe same right of private defence which he would have if Z were  sane.  \n \n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A \nfor a house­breaker, attacks A. Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits \nno offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which he would have if \nZ were not acting under that  misconception.  \n \n99. Acts against whi ch there is no right of private defence. There is no right of private defence \nagainst an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, \nor attempted to be done by a public servant acting in good faith under colo ur of his office, though that \nact may not be strictly justifiable by law. \n \nThere is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the \napprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction  of a \npublic servant acting in good faith under colour of his office though that direction may not be strictly \njustifiable by law. \n \nThere is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the \nprotection of the public authorities.  \n \nExtent to which the right may be exercised. The right of private defence in no case extends to \nthe inflicting of more harm t han it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.  \n \nExplanation  1. A person  is not deprived  of the right of private  defence  against  an act done,  or \nattempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that the \nperson doing the act is such public servant.  \n \nExplanation  2. A person  is not deprived  of the right of private  defence  against  an act done,  or \nattempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, \nthat the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority \nunder which he acts, or if he has authority in writ ing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded.  \n \n100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death. The right of \nprivate defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to \nthe voluntary  causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which  occasions  \nthe exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely :  \nPage 44 of 178   First. — Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehen sion that death will otherwise be \nthe consequence of such assault  ; \n \nSecondly. — Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will \notherwise be the consequence of such assault ;  \n \nThirdly. — An assault with the intention of comm itting rape ; \nFourthly. — An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust ;  \nFifthly.  \n \nSixthly.  An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting ;  \n \nAn assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under  circumstances  \nwhich may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public \nauthorities for his release.  \n \n101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death. If the offence be not of \nany of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the \nbody does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the \nrestrictions ment ioned in section 99 to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than \ndeath.  \n \n102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body. The right  \nof private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the \nbody arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been \ncommitted ; and it continues as long as such, apprehension of danger to the body  continues.  \n \n103. When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death. The right of \nprivate defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the volun tary \ncausing of death or of any other harm to the wrong­doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or \nthe attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the des­ \ncriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely  :— \n \nFirst.— Robbery ;  \n \nSecondly. — House­breaking by night ;  \n \nThirdly. — Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or \nvessel is used as a human dwelling or as a place for the custody of property ;  \n \nFourthly. — Theft, mischief or house­trespass, under such circumstances as may reasonably cause \napprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is \nnot exercised.  \n \nPage 45 of 178   104. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death. If the offence, the \ncommitting of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right of private \ndefence, be theft, mischief, or criminal trespass, not of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last \npreceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, \nsubject to the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrong­doer of any \nharm other than  death.  \n \n105. Commencement and continuance of  the right  of private defence of  property.  The right of \nprivate defence of property commences when a reasonable apprehension of danger to the property \ncommences.  \n \nThe right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effect ed his \nretreat with the property or either the assistance of the public authorities is obtained, or the property \nhas been recovered.  \n \nThe right of private defence of properly against robbery continues as long as the offender causes \nor attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant \ndeath or of instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues.  \n \nThe right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as \nthe o ffender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief.  \n \nThe right of private defence of property against house­breaking by night continues as long as the \nhouse­trespass which has been begun by such house­breaking continues.  \n \n106. Right of private  defence against deadly assault when there is risk of harm to innocent \nperson. If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes \nthe apprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually e xercise that right \nwithout risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that \nrisk. \n \nIllustration  \n \nA is attached by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of \nprivate defence without firing on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children \nwho are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if by so f iring he harms any of the children.  \n \n \n \nCHAPTER V \nOF ABETMENT  \n107. Abetment of a thing. A person abets the doing of a thing,  who— \nFirst. — Instigates any person to do that thing ;  or, \n \nPage 46 of 178   Secondly.  Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing  of \nthat thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the \ndoing of that thing ; or  \n \nThirdly.  Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that  thing.  \n \nExplanation  1. A person  who,  by willful  misrepresentation,  or by willful  concealment  of a \nmaterial fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attemp ts to cause or \nprocure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA, a public officer, is authorized by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z. B, knowing \nthat fact and also that C is not Z, willfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes \nA to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C.  \n \nExplanation  2. Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an  act, does \nanything in order to facilitate th e commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission \nthereof is said to aid the doing of that act.  \n \n108. Abettor. A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the \ncommission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of \ncommitting an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the  abettor.  \n \nExplanation  1. The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an  offence  \nalthough the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.  \n \nExplanation  2. To constitute  the offence  of abetment  it is not necessary  that the act abetted  \nshould be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A instigates B to murder C, B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit  murder.  \n \n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the \nwound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit  murder.  \n \nExplanation  3. It is not necessary  that the person  abetted  should  be capable  by law of \ncommitting an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the \nabettor or any guilty intention or knowledge.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an \noffence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having \nthe same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting \nan offence.  \n \nPage 47 of 178   (b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do \nan act which causes Z‘s death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the \nabsence of A and thereby, causes Z‘s death. Here, though B was not capable by law of \ncommitting an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been \ncapable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore \nsubject to the punishment of  death. \n \n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling­house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his \nmind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong \nor contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A‘s instigation. B has \ncommitted no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to dwelling­ \nhouse, and is liable to the punishment provided for that  offence.  \n \n(d) A intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belong ing to Z \nout of Z‘s possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the \nproperty out of Z‘s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A‘s property. B, acting \nunder this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. \nBut A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liab1e to the same punishment as if B had commit­ \nted theft.  \n \nExplanation 4. \nis also an offence.  The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an  abetment  \n \n \n \nIllustration  \n \nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits \nthat offence in consequence of B‘s instig ation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the \npunishment for murder ; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same \npunishment.  \n \nExplanation  5. It is not necessary  to the commission  of the offence  of abetment  by conspiracy  \nthat the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he \nengages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.  \n \n \nIllustration  \n \nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed t hat A shall administer the poison. B then \nexplains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without \nmentioning A‘s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the \npurpose of its being use d in the manner explained. A administers the poison ; Z dies in consequence. \nHere, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in \npursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined  in this \nsection and is liable to the punishment for  murder.  \n \n. \nPage 48 of 178   1[108.A. Abetment in Pakistan of offences outside it. A person abets an offence within the \nmeaning of this Code who, in 2[Pakistan], abets the commission of any act without and beyond \n2[Pakistan] which would constitute an offence committed in 2[Pakistan].  \nIllustration  \n \nA, in 2[Pakistan], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa. A is guilty of \nabetting mur der.] \n \n109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no \nexpress provision is made for its punishment. Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is \ncommitted in consequence of the abetment, and no express provisio n is made by this Code for the \npunishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the  offence[:]3 \n4[Provided that, except in case of Ikrah­i­Tam the abettor of an offence referred to in Chapter \nXVI shall be liable to punishment of ta‘zir specified for such offence including  death.].  \n \nExplanation.  An act or offence  is said to be committed  in consequence  of abetment,  when  it is \ncommitted in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which \nconstitutes the abetment.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the \nexercise of B‘s official functions. B accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined \nin section  161. \n \n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation commits that \noffence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as  B. \n \n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and \ndelivers it to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, \nadministers the poison to Z in A's absence and thereby c auses Z‘s death. Here B is guilty \nof murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable  to the \npunishment for  murder.  \n \n110. Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from that of \nabettor. Whoever abets the  commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a \ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided \nfor the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or \nknowledge of the abettor and with no other.  \n \n111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done. When an act is abetted \nand a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same \nextent as if he had directly abetted it : \n \n1This Section was added by the Indian Penal Code Amdt. Act, 1898 (4 of 1898), s. 3.  \n2Subs. by the Central Laws (Statute Reform) Ordinance, 1960 (21 of 1960),s. 3 and 2nd Sch. (w.e.f. 14th October, 1955), for ―t he Provinces and the Capital of the Federation‖ which had \nbeen subs. by A.O., 1949, Arts. 3(2) and 4, for ―British India‖.  \n3Subs. b y the criminal law (Amdt.), Act, 1997 (II of 1997), s. 6 for ―full­stop‖.  \n4Proviso added ibid.  \nPage 49 of 178   Proviso. Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed \nunder the influence of the instigation, or with th e aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which \nconstituted the abetment.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. \nThe child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of  \nY, which is by the side of that of Z. Here if the child was acting under the influence of A's \ninstigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence of the \nabetment A is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had instigated the \nchild to put the poison into the food of  Y. \n \n(b) A instigates B to burn Z's house. B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits \ntheft of property there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty \nof abetting the theft ; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of \nthe burning.  \n \n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of \nrobbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and \nbeing resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable \nconsequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for  murder.  \n \n112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done. If the \nact for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act \nabetted, and constitutes a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the  offences.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in  consequence, resists \nthat distress. In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the \ndistress. As B h as committed both the offence of resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily \ncausing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences ; and, if A new that B was \nlikely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for \neach of the offences.  \n \n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended \nby the abettor. When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a \nparticular effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a \ndifferent effect from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in  the \nsame manner and to the same extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that \neffect, provided he knew that the act abetted was likely to cause that  effect.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z, B, in consequ ence of the instigation, causes grievous \nhurt to Z. Z dies in consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause \ndeath. A is liable to be punished with the punishment provided for murder.  \n \nPage 50 of 178   114. Abettor present when offence is committed. Whenever any person, who if absent would be \nliable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be \npunishable in consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such \nact or  offence.  \n \n115. Abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life if offence not \ncommitted; Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or 1[imprisonment \nfor life], shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express pro­ \nvision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of \neither description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine  ; \n \nif act causing harm be done in consequence. and if any act for which the abettor is liable in \nconsequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable \nto imprisonment of either descriptio n for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be \nliable to fine.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have \nbeen subject to the punishment of death or imprisonment for life. Therefore A is liable  to \nimprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to a fine ; and, if any hurt be done \nto Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend  \nto fourteen years, and  to fine. \n \n116. Abetment  of offence  punishable  with  imprisonment  if offence  be not \ncommitted; Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not \ncommitted in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the \npunishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of any descriptio n provided for that \noffence for a term which may extend to one­fourth part of the longest term provided for that offence; \nor with such fine as is provided for that offence, or with both ;  \n \nif abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is t o prevent offence. and if the \nabettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such \noffence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, \nfor a term which may extend to one­half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such \nfine as is provided for the offence, or with both.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the \nexercise of B‘s official  functions. B refuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this \nsection.  \n \n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has \nnevertheless committed the offence defined in this section, and is punishable  accordingly.  \n \n1Subs. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972),s.2 and Sch., for ―transportation for life‖.  \nPage 51 of 178   (c) A, a police­officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. \nHere, though the robbery be not committed, A is liable to one­half of the longest term of \nimprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine. \n \n(d) B abets the commission of a robbery by A, a police­officer, whose duty it is to prevent \nthat of fence. Here though the robbery be not committed, B is liable to one­half of the \nlongest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and also to fine. \n \n117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons. Whoever \nabets the  commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons \nexceeding ten, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend \nto three years, or with fine, or with both.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA affixes in a public place a placard instigating a sect consisting of more than ten members to \nmeet at a certain time and place, for the purpose of attacking the members of an adverse sect, while \nengaged in a procession. A has committed the offence define d in this section.  \n \n118. Concealing design to commit offence punishable with  death  or  imprisonment  for  \nlife. Whoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the \ncommission of an offence punishable with death or l[imprisonment for life], \nif offence be committed; voluntarily conceals, by any act or illegal omission, the existence of a \ndesign to commit such offence or makes any representation which he knows to be false respecting \nsuch design,  \n \nif offence be not committed; shall, if that offence be committed, be punished with imprisonment \nof either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or, if the offence be not committed, \nwith imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years ; and in either \ncase shall also be liable to fine. \n \nIllustration  \n \nA, knowing that dacoity is about to be committed at B, falsely informs the Magistrate that a \ndacoity is about to be committed  at C, a place in an opposite direction, and thereby misleads the \nMagistrate with intent to facilitate the commission of the offence. The dacoity is committed at B in \npursuance of the design. A is punishable under this section.  \n \n119.

The punishment of dacoity is \n2[imprisonment for life], or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, with or without \nfine. A, therefore, is liable to 4[such imprisonment for life] or imprisonment, with or without fine.  \n196. Using evidence known to be false.

Force. A person is said to use force to another if he causes motion, change of motion, or \ncessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, \nor cessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other's body, or with \nanything which that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such c ontact affects \nthat other's sense of feeling : Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or \ncessation of motion, causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three \nways hereinafter described  : \n \nFirst . By his own bodily  power.  \n \nSecondly . By disposing  any substance  in such a manner  that the motion  or change  or cessation  \nof motion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person.  \n \nThirdly . By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to  move.  \n \n350. Criminal force. Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person's \nconsent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to c ause, or \nknowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the \nperson to whom the force is used, is said to use criminal force to that  other.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally \ncauses the boat to drift down the stream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he \ndoes this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is produced without \nany other action on any person ‘s part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if \nhe has done so without Z‘s consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or \nintending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear or \nannoyance to Z, A has us ed criminal force to  Z. \n \n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z‘s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their \npace. Here A has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their \nmotion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z‘s consent, \nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has \nused criminal force to  Z. \n \n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. \nHere A h as caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily \npower. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without Z‘s \nconsent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to  Z. \n \nlAs to punishment for an offence under s. 354 enquired into by a Council of Elders in a Punjab Frontier District, in the N.W.F.P. or in Baluchistan see the Frontier Crime Regulation, 1901  \n(3 of 1901),s.12.  \nPage 125 of 178   (d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved \nhis own person so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used \nforce to Z; and if he has done so without Z‘s consent, intending or knowing it to be likely  \nthat he may ther eby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to  Z. \n \n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought \ninto contact with Z, or with Z‘s clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will \nstrike w ater, and dash up the water against Z‘s clothes or something carried by Z. Here, if \nthe throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into \ncontact with Z, or Z‘s clothes, A has used force to Z; and if he did so without Z‘s conse nt, \nintending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to  Z. \n \n(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he \ndoes so without her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby \ninjure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to  her. \n \n(g) Z is bathing, A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A \nintentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling water as brings \nthat water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact must  \naffect Z‘s sense of feeling: A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has \ndone this without Z‘s consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may  thereby \ncause injury, fear or annoyance to Z. A has used criminal  force.  \n \n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z‘s consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, \nfear or annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to  Z. \n \n351. Assault. Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be \nlikely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes \nthat gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.  \n \nExplanation.  Mere  words  do not amount  to an assault.  But the words  which  a person  uses may \ngive to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations \namount to an assault.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to \nbelieve that A is about to strike Z. A has committed an  assault.  \n \n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending, or knowing it to be likely \nthat he may thereby cause Z to believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has \ncommitted an assault upon  Z. \n \n(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, ―I wi1l give you a beating‖. Here, though the words used \nby A could in no case amount to an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied \nby any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault, the gesture explained by the \nwords may amount to an  assault.  \n \n \n \n \n. \nPage 126 of 178   352.

Theft. Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any moveable property out of the possession \nof any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to \ncommit  theft.  \n \n1Subs. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s. 2 and Sch., for ―transportation for life‖.  \n2Ins. by Act VI of 06, s. 5.  \n3Ins. by Act X of 2016, s. 7.  \nPage 133 of 178   Explanation  1. A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being move able property, is not \nthe subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from \nthe earth.  \n \nExplanation  2. \n \nExplanation  3. A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft.  \n \nA person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which  \nprevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.  \n \nExplanation  4. A person,  who by any means  causes  an animal  to move,  is said to move  that \nanimal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that \nanimal.  \n \nExplanation  5. The consent  mentioned  in the definition  may be expressed  or implied,  and may \nbe given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either \nexpress or implied.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z‘s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of \nZ‘s possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to \nsuch taking, he has committed  theft.  \n \n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z‘s dog to follow it. H ere, if A's \nintention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z‘s possession without Z‘s consent, A has \ncommitted theft as soon as Z‘s dog has begun to follow  A. \n \n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, \nin order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, \nA has committed theft of the  treasure.  \n \n(d) A being Z‘s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z‘s plate, dishonestly runs away \nwith the plate, without Z‘s consent. A has committed theft.  \n \n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. \nA carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z‘s possession. It \ncould not therefore be taken out of Z‘s possession and A has not committed theft, though \nhe may have committed criminal breach of  trust.  \n \n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in \nZ‘s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits  theft.  \n \n(g) A finds a ring lying on the high­road, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, \ncommits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of  property.  \nPage 134 of 178   (h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z‘s house. N ot venturing to misappropriate \nthe ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it \nis highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring \nfrom the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first \nmoving the ring, commits  theft.  \n \n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing \nto the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain t he watch as a \nsecurity, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z‘s hand, and carries it \naway. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not \ncommitted theft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly.  \n \n(j) If A owns money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a \nsecurity for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z‘s possession, with the intention of \ndepriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inas much as he \ntakes it dishonestly.  \n \n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z‘s possession without Z's \nconsent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, be commits theft, though the \nwatch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.  \n \n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z‘s possession with out Z‘s consent, with the \nintention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here \nA takes dishonestly ; A has therefore committed  theft.  \n \n(m) A, bein g on friendly terms with Z, goes in to Z‘s library in Z‘s absence, and takes away a \nbook without Z‘s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the \nintention of returning it. Here, it is probable than A may have conceived that he had Z‘s \nimplied consent to use Z‘s book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed  theft.  \n \n(n) A asks charity from Z‘s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to \nbelong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z‘s wife is \nauthorized to give away alms. If this was A‘s impression, A has not committed  theft.  \n \n(o) A is the paramour of Z‘s wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows to belong to \nher husband Z, and to be such property as she has not authority from Z to give.

A is not guilty of theft; but if A, \nafter discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is \nguilty of an offence under this section.  \n \n1Ins. by the Pakistan Penal Code (Second Amendment) Ordinance, 1981 (30 of 1981), s. 2.  \n2Ins by Act 26 of 2011,s.4.  \nPage 140 of 178   (b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z‘s library in Z‘s absence and takes away a \nbook without Z‘s express consent. Here, if A was under the impression, that he had Z‘s \nimplied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft. \nBut if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefi t, he is guilty of an offence under this \nsection.  \n \n(c) A and B, being joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B‘s possession, intending \nto use it. Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. \nBut, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own use, he is guilty  \nof an offence under this  section.  \n \nExplanation  1. A dishonest  misappropriation  for a time only is a misappropriation  within  the \nmeaning of this section.  \n \nIllustration  \n \nA finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing \nthat the note belongs to Z, pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan, intending at a future time \nto restore it to Z.

A picks up the \nrupee. Here A has not committed the offence defined in this section.  \n \n(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank note. From the direction and contents of the \nletter he learns to whom the note belongs. He appropriates the note.

A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty \nof an offence under this  section.  \n \nPage 141 of 178   (d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of \nrestoring it to Z, but afterwards appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an \noffence under this  section.  \n \n(e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers that \nit belongs to Z, and appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this \nsection.  \n \n(f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately without \nattempt ing to discover the owner.

A has committed criminal breach o f trust.  \n \n(b) A is a warehouse­keeper. Z, going on a journey, entrusts his furniture to A, under a \ncontract that it shall be returned on payment of a stipulated sum for warehouse­room. A \ndishonestly sells the goods. A has committed criminal breach of  trust.  \nPage 142 of 178   (c) A, residing in 1[Dacca], is agent for Z, residing at 2[Lahore].

Z, remits a lakh of rupees to A, with directions to A to \ninvest the same in Company‘s paper. A dishonestly disobeys the directions and employs \nthe money in his own business. A has committed criminal breach of  trust.  \n \n(d) But if A, in the last illustration, not dishonestly but in good faith, believing that it will be \nmore for Z‘s advantage to hold shares in the Bank of Bengal, disobeys Z‘s directions, and \nbuys shares in the Bank of Bengal, for Z, instead of buying Company‘s paper, here, \nthough Z should suffer loss, and should be entitled to bring a civil action against A, on \naccount of that loss, yet A, not having acted dishonestly, has not committed criminal \nbreach of  trust.  \n \n(e) A, a revenue­officer, is entrusted with public money and is eithe r directed by law, or \nbound by a contract, express or implied, with the Government, to pay into a certain \ntreasury all the public money which he holds.

Forgery. Whoever makes any false document or part of a document, with intent to cause damage or \ninjury, to the public or to any person, or to support any claim or title, or to cause any person to part with \nproperty, or to enter into any express or implied contract, or with intent to commit fraud or that fraud may be \ncommitted, commits  forgery.  \n \nPage 161 of 178   464. Making a false document. A person is said to make a false  document  \n \nFirstly.  Who dishonestly or fraudulently makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of  a \ndocument, or makes any mark denoting the execution of a document with the intention of causing it to be \nbelieved that such document or part of a document was made, signed, sealed or executed by or by the authority \nof a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed or executed, or at a \ntime at which he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed or ex ecuted ; or  \n \nSecondly.  Who, without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation  or otherwise, alters  \na document in any material part thereof, after it has been made or executed either by himself or by any other \nperson, whether such person be living or dead at the time of such alteration ; or  \n \nThirdly.  Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or alter a  document,  \nknowing that such person by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that by reason of \ndeception practised upon him he does not know the contents of the document or the nature of the alteration.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to defraud B, adds a \ncipher to the 10,000 and makes the sum 1,00,000, intending that it may be believed by B that Z so \nwrote the letter. A has committed  forgery.  \n \n(b) A, without Z‘s authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate \nfrom Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the \npurchase­money. A has committed  forgery.  \n \n(c) A picks up a cheque on  a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been \ninserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand \nrupees. A commits  forgery.  \n \n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable \nand authorizes B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the \npurpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of \ntwenty thousand rupee s. B commits  forgery.  \n \n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B‘s authority, intending to discount \nit as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws \nthe bill with intent to deceiv e the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, \nand thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.  \n \n(f) Z‘s will contains these words­\"I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between \nA, B and C.\" A dishonestly scratches out B‘s name, intending that it may be believed that the \nwhole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.  \n \n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the \nbill the words ―Pay to Z or his order‖ and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words \n―Pay to Z or his order‖ and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B \ncommits  forgery.  \n \nPage 162 of 178   (h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate executes a \nconveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, \nintending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has \ncommitted  forgery.  \n \n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the  legatee named by \nZ, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to \nsign the will. A has committed  forgery.  \n \n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B‘s name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good \ncharacter and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune , intending by means of such \nletter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to \ninduce Z to part with property. A has committed  forgery.  \n \n(k) A without B‘s authority writes a letter and signs it in B‘s name certifying to A‘s character, intending \nthereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to \ndeceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied \ncontract for  service.  \n \nExplanation 1. A man‘s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was  \ndrawn by another person of the same name. A has committed  forgery.  \n \n(b) A writes the word ―accepted‖ on a piece of paper and signs it with Z‘s name, in order that B may \nafterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as \nthough it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery ; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill \nupon the paper pursuant to A‘s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.  \n \n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A \nendorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the \nperson to whose order it was payable, here A has committed forgery.  \n \n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B after the seizure of the estate, \nin collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and \ndates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be \nbelieved that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own \nname, commits forgery by antedating  it. \n \n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A‘s benefit, and with intent to \ndefraud his creditors ; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note \nbinding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may \nbe believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery  \nunder the first head of  the definition.  \n \nExplanation  2. The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be \nbelieved that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be \nbelieved that the document was made by the person in his life time, may amount to forgery.  \n \nPage 163 of 178   Illustration  \n \nA draws a bill of e xchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name \nof such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.  \n \n465. Punishment for forgery.
