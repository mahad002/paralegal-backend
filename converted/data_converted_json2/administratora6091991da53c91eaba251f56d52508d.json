Resolution and Principal  \nDecisions of Government  \nCabinet Secretariat  \n(Establishment Branch)  \nKarachi, the 8th November, 1950  \nRESOLUTION  \nNo.F.25/4/50 -Ests(SEI) .— Before the Partition, the premier administrative \nService in India was the Indian Civil Service. This was a single service divided up i nto a \nnumber of cadres on a Provincial basis. Officers appointed to this Service were allotted to \nthe various Provinces and they remained members of the Indian Civil Service cadre of \ntheir Provinces throughout their careers. The Central Government met the ir own needs \nby the deputation of officers from the provinces. There was also in undivided India the \nIndian Political Service, the two main sources of recruitment to which were the Indian \nCivil Service and the Indian Army.  \n2. The Government of Pakistan hav e decided to constitute their Civil Service \nas a centralized Service on a All -Pakistan Basis. It will be called THE CIVIL SERVICE \nOF PAKISTAN. This decision has been taken in order to create a well -knit Civil Service \nfor the whole of Pakistan, constituted and operated on a centralized basis, thereby \nincreasing association between the various Provinces and developing homogeneity in \nadministration. The members of this Service, who shall be liable to be posted to any of \nthe Provinces of the Dominion, will be a dministratively more useful to the *Central as \nwell as the Provinc ial Governm ents than if they belonged to Provincial Cadres, because \nof the knowledge and experience they will acquire by serving in the Provinces of West \nPakistan as well as in [East Pakis tan,] and uniform standards of administration in all \nparts of the Dominion will also be achieved.  \n3. The Civil Service of Pakistan shall consist of a *central cadre as distinct \nfrom the Provincial cadres of the former Indian Civil Service.

Depending \nupon number of options to be exercised by the officers of Pakistan Customs Service and \nInland Revenue Service, the tentative cadre strength of new Inland Revenue Service and \nPakistan Customs Service may be as under (i.e. equivalent to existing combined strength \nof the Inland Revenue Service and Pakistan Customs Service): —  \nNew Inland Revenue Service  \n Functions    Officers  \n Federal Excise    218  \n Sales Tax  \n Inland Revenue Service   978  \n Total     1196  \n Pakistan Customs Service  \nFunctions      Officers  \nCustoms      218  \nPage -32                        ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -2                                                      \n \n  Upon completion of exercise of options, the exact cadre strength shall be \nfinalized by the Establishment Division in consultation with Reve nue Division.  \n(b) Scenario -II  \n In case all the officers of the Customs and Excise Group and Income Tax Group opt \nfor new Service, the Service be renamed as ―Pakistan Revenue Service‖ with common \nseniority and doing all the revenue and tax business. All o fficers would be part of one cadre. \nThe tentative cadre strength of new service may be as under (i.e. equivalent to existing \ncombined strength of the Inland Revenue Service and Pakistan Customs Service): —  \n Functions    Officers  \n Federal Excise    218  \n Sales Tax  \n Income Tax    978  \n Customs    218  \n Total     1414  \n Upon completion of exercise of options, the exact cadre strength shall be \nfinalized by the Establishment Division in consultation with Revenue Division.  \n 5. In both the scenarios mentioned in  para-4 above, the Income Tax Group \nofficers not opting for the new service will remain in the existing Income Tax Group \nwhich will be a defunct and dying cadre without any future intake.  \n 6. The inter -se-seniority  of the officers of existing Inland Revenue Service \nand Pakistan Customs Service exercising option for inclusion in the new Pakistan \nRevenue Service or Inland Service, as the case may be, shall count from the date of \nregular appointment in the present post  in the existing Customs and Excise Group and \nIncome Tax Group in accordance with Civil Servants (Seniority) Rules, 1993, as \namended from time to time.  \n 7.  Other measures shall be taken as under: —  \n(a) All the existing posts currently forming part of Income Tax Group as well \nas those meant for Federal Excise Business but currently forming part of \nCustoms and Excise Group shall form part of the new Inland Revenue \nService with immediate effect. The said posts will, however, be \ntransferred to the new Service upo n completion of exercise of option.  \n(b) Further recruitment to the existing Income Tax Group is stopped.  \n(c) Effective from 2009, fresh recruitment to the newly constituted Inland \nRevenue Service or Pakistan Revenue Service as the case may be, shall be \ninitiated  through Federal Public Service Commission.  \nCHAPTER -2                         ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                          Page -33                                                               \n \n  8.

Under Article 240 of the Constitution, appointments to and conditions  of \nservice of persons in the All -Pakistan Services are to be determined by the Federal \nGovernment. The concept of All -Pakistan Services has been retained in the Constitution \nwith a broader national purpose, viz. national integration and cohesion. It is, t herefore, \nemphasized that all matters pertaining to the appointment, promotion, transfer, etc. of \nmembers of the [All Pakistan Unified Grades] are the responsibility of Federal \nGovernment.  \n 11. In the past, substantive appointments to posts in *Grade 18 were made on the \nrecommendations of the Federal Public Service Commission by the Federal Government after \nconsulting the Provinces concerned. This procedure was, however, reduced to a mere \nformality as the Provinces who were permitted to make officiating a ppointments on \ntemporary basis continued such appointments without interruption. For appointments to \n*Grades above 18, no reference to Federal Public Service Commission was necessary; in their \ncase recommendations were made by the Provinces to the Federal Government and with their \napproval promotions were made. While making officiating appointments or making \nrecommendations for promotions, the Provinces usually considered only those Government \nservants who were working within their jurisdiction. The cases o f senior persons with good \nrecord of service working at the Centre or in other Provinces were generally not considered \nby the Provinces. This procedure now requires modification for various reasons. Firstly, under \nthe revised procedure consultation with  Federal Public Service Commission in the matter of \nsubstantive promotion to *Grade 18 is no longer necessary and, therefore, distinction between \nofficiating and substantive appointments is no longer valid. Secondly, as a result of the \nintroduction of the administrative reforms a number of officers from other services have been \ninducted into All Pakistan Services. It is, therefore, necessary that their claim for promotion \nshould also be fully taken into account before making appointments to higher *Grades.  \n 12. It has, therefore, been decided that:  \n                                                           \n BPS \n All Pakistan Services (Change in Nomenclature) Rules, 1973, notified vide SRO 1307(I)/73 dated 14 -09-\n1973, have been repealed vide SRO 89(I)/2014 dated 14 -02-2014, whereby  all notifications and instructions \nissued on the subject from time to time were mutatis mutandis  amended.  \n Federal Government.  \nPage -36                        ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -2                                                      \n \n (i) A Central Selection Committee under the Establishment Secretary in \nwhich Chief Secretaries of the Provinces would be associated would make \nrecommendations for promotion to Grade 18 and above.

Division‘s \nO.M No. 1/3/201 4-T.V dated 26 -12-2016 on the above cited subject is withdrawn ab-\ninitio .  \n 2. As per decision of the Islamabad High Court, ―on the strength of already \ncompeted CTP a repeater with improved score will not be allowed seniority on the basis \nof the same and seniority has to be fixed amongst new batch in a particular group. \nHowever any repeater (candidate) showing his intent to improve score in CTP is allowed \nto join the same.‖  \n 3. As a result of Islamabad High Court Order dated 31 -10-2017, the practice \nprior to issuance of Establishment Division‘s O.M mentioned above stands restored.  As \nsuch, those candidates who change their occupational group as a result of repeating CSS \nCE will not repeat CTP, continue their posting in their former occupational group/servic e \nand join their new occupational group/service on the commencement of their respective \nSTPs only alongwith their batch mates of the new occupational group/service. This will \napply to the officers who are presently repeating the ongoing 45th CTP.  \n 4. No o fficer will be allowed to join STP of their new occupational \nGroup/Service with the senior batch of any previous CTP to ensure comparative merit.  \n 5. This O.M. supersedes all previous O.Ms in conflict with the above stated \nposition to the extent indicated  above.  \n 6.   Controlling Ministries/Divisions/Departments of various Occupational \nGroups/Services are advised to follow the above mentioned guidelines.  \n  [Authority .— Establishment Division‘s O.M.No. 5/6/2017-T.V dated 01-02-2018]. \n                                                           \n Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance,2000 has been repealed vide Section 2(1) of the Act No. \nIII of 2010.  \nCHAPTER -2                         ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                          Page -81                                                               \n \n  4.2 Determination of Inter -se-Seniority  of  \nOfficers of All Occupational Groups  \n Refer to the subject above and to state that in light of Occupational Groups and \nServices (Probation, Training and Seniority) Rules,1990, a number of queries have been \nreceived by this Division re garding determination of inter -se-seniority . According to sub -\nrule 4 of Rule 7 of Occupational Groups and Services (Probation, Training and Seniority) \nRules,1990 inter -se-seniority  of probationers is determined on the basis of aggregate of \nfollowing marks obtained by the probationers.   \ni) Marks obtained in the competitive examination of FPSC or notional marks \n(in case of inductees as per Rules 7(2);  \nii) Marks obtained in the initial training program (CTP) or notional marks (in \ncase of inductees as per Rules 7(3);  \niii) Marks obtained in the specialized training program (STP);  \niv) Marks obtained by qualifying in Final Passing Out Examination in the \n‗first attempt‘.  \n 2. A question has arisen as to how the seniority of those probationers should \nbe fixed who are not able to qual ify the Final Passing Out Examination in the first and \nsecond attempt. Matter is considered in Establishment Division and clarified as under: — \n(a) A probationer failing to qualify FPOE in first attempt will only have \nincrements withheld while his/her seniority will not be affected so long as \nhe/she passes in second attempt. To determine inter -se-seniority  aggregate \nmarks obtained (as stated in sub pa ras i-iv above) will be used to calculate \nthe probationer‘s placement in the seniority list.  \n(b) A probationer who fails to qualify FPOE in second attempt but does it in \nthird attempt will be relegated to the bottom of the seniority list \nirrespective of aggreg ate marks obtained.  \n 3. Ministries/Divisions/Departments concerned of all Occupational Groups \nand Services should follow the above mentioned guidelines to determine inter -se-\nseniority  of the probationers in future.  \n[Authority: — Establishment Division‘s O.M.No.1/3/2014 -T.V dated 21 -04-2014].  \n 4.3 Determination of Inter -se-Seniority  of Officers of  \nAll Occupational Groups and Services  \n Refer to the subject cited above and to state that in continuation to this \nDivision‘s O.M.

With regard to queries received by this Division on determination of inter -\nse-seniority of probationers who are allowed deferment from Common Training Program, \nthe Competent Authority is plea sed to inform that in such cases inter -se-seniority of \nprobationers, henceforth, will be fixed at the bottom of the batch with which the \nprobationer undergoes CTP. It is further stated that while granting deferment a note to \nthis effect should be clearly c ommunicated to the probationary officer to bring it to \nhis/her notice.  \nPage -82                        ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -2                                                      \n \n  3.

It was mentioned in the notice issued by the Federal Public Service \nCommission for the 1960 examination that the senior ity of candidates in question would be \naccording to their order of merit in the competitive examination. Furthermore, no mention \nabout the fixation of inter-se-seniority,  or about Seniority Rules which were then to be \nframed, was made in the notices for th e 1961 and 1962 examinations and the Section \nOfficers (Probation, Training and Seniority) Rules, 1964, did not prescribe the principles of \nseniority, with retrospective effect, for Section Officers appointed on the basis of those \nexaminations.  \n 4.

Some \ndoubt seems to exist about the correct interpretation of this provision. The provision is \nexplained below.  \n 2. Posts in which was for merly Senior Administrative Grade were placed in \nNational Pay Scale No.20 with effect from 1st March, 1972. Therefore, the holders of \nSenior Administrative Grade could not be said to be in Grade 20 earlier than 1st March, \n1972. Consequently, the seniority of an officer who had been holding a post in Senior \nAdministrative Grade and was later appointed as Joint Secretary would be reckoned from \n1st March, 1972, or the date of appointment as Joint Secretary, whichever is earlier.  \n[Authority. -Estt.

It  is, therefore, necessary to check thoroughly the genuineness of certificates \nwhere the bonafides of persons employed after the 15th August, 1947 are  in doubt. One \nmethod of checking is to make a reference to the universities which issued the certificates. If \nthis method does not prove successful, cross examination (and other suitable methods which \nmay be possible according to the merits of the case) o f the individuals concerned by the \nappointing authorities themselves may be resorted to. The candidates concerned may also be \nrequired to produce two certificates from Gazetted officers in support of their claim to \neducational qualifications.  \n 2.  There ma y also be cases where the certificates produced are genuine but \nthere is a reasonable doubt that they do not relate to the persons producing them.  In such \ncases, the matter will have to be referred to the District Police authorities for investigation \nand report.  \n 3.  In so far as the competitive examinations conducted by the Federal Public \nService Commission are concerned, the original age and educational certificates submitted by \nthe candidates with their applications are fully checked, and necessary enqu iries made in all \ndoubtful cases.  But, as regards recruitment by selection, the candidates are not generally \nrequired to submit their original certificates with their applications. Only attested copies are \ncalled for. In these cases, it is essential for t he appointing authorities to verify the claims of the \ncandidates as regards age and educational qualifications in the same manner in which their \nantecedents are verified before appointment. If it is found that a forged certificate has been \nproduced or that  the individual, producing a certificate, is not the one to whom it was issued, \nsuitable disciplinary action must be taken against the person concerned, including dismissal \nfrom government service, (if the persons are in government service) and a ban on fu ture \nemployment.  In specific cases the matter should be reported to the Police for criminal \nprosecution.  \n 4. Generally, candidates for recruitment made by selection are required to send \npassport size copies of their photographs with their applications.  B ut this is not compulsory. \nIt is considered desirable to ask all candidates to submit such photographs with their \napplications.  \n [Authority: – Estt.

It has now been d ecided by the Government of Pakistan that recruitment from \nabroad should be made in the manner indicated in the following paragraphs.  \n 2. If a Ministry considers that it is necessary to make recruitment to civil \nposts from abroad, it should make a referenc e to the Federal Public Service Commission, \nasking them to agree to such recruitment and if they agree, to proceed without delay to \ntake all the steps necessary to make such recruitment. The Federal Public Service \nCommission will themselves advertise the p ost or posts abroad and make necessary \narrangements for the candidates to be interviewed by Special Selection Committee. \nThereafter, the Federal Public Service Commission will make recommendations for the \nfilling of the post or posts in question.  In no ca se should the Ministry itself take steps to \nadvertise the post.  \n 3. There may, however, be exceptional cases in which the Ministries \nconcerned are of the view that recruitment from abroad through the Federal Public \nService Commission will prove infructuous , e.g., in the case of appointments to highly \ntechnical posts or other posts of considerable importance in connection with which \npersons of high standing abroad are not likely to respond to advertisements and appear \nfor interviews.  In such cases, which sh ould be very rare, the prior approval of the Prime \nMinister will be necessary for recruitment to be made by the Ministry concerned without \nthe assistance of the Federal Public Service Commission.  The procedure to be adopted in \nsuch cases will be that the matter should be referred to the Establishment Division so that \nthe orders of the Prime Minister can be obtained. Such reference to the Establishment \nDivision should be made only after the Federal Public Service Commission have first \nagreed to recruitment to the post in question being made from abroad, and it should be \naccompanied by a Summary for the Prime Minister, explaining why it is necessary for \nrecruitment to be made otherwise than through the Federal Public Service Commission \nand showing what steps the Ministry have in mind for filling the post or posts in question.  \n [Authority :– Estt.

FRAMING OF RECRUITMENT RULES  \n 2.1 Framing of Recruitment Rules  \n The methods of appointment of Federal civil posts are regulated under the \nprovisions of the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rules, 1973 framed \nunder Section 25 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973. As these rules provide the basic framework \nfor appointment to Federal ci vil posts, instructions were issued vide Establishment Division \nO.M.No. 9/1/73 -D.V., dated 29.11.73 laying down a simplified format for notifying \nrecruitment rules since the earlier pattern of detailed recruitment rules for various \nposts/cadres was no long er considered necessary. The system has its advantages but over the \nyears, the framing of recruitment rules has become an increasingly mechanical exercise and \nis now reduced to simply inserting uniform standards (of educational requirements, \nexperience, ag e limits, etc) for equivalent posts in various departments. As a result, the \nrecruitment rules are no more viewed as important and essential instruments of career \nplanning nor do they properly reflect the job requirements particularly in technical \nposts/ca dres. This trend should be reversed and recruitment rules for various posts/cadres \nshould be framed with greater care to serve, on the one hand, as instruments of career \nplanning for the officials concerned and on the other, be tailored around the job requ irements \nparticularly in technical cadres.  \n 2. It is, therefore, requested that, while framing recruitment rules, due \nconsideration should be given to job descriptions for laying down the qualifications/  \nexperience for posts and the composition of cadre for prescribing percentage, for direct \nrecruitment and promotions. Efforts should be made to safeguard both the department's \ninterest in raising a fully -qualified and experienced cadre and the career interests of its \nmembers whose promotions are governed u nder the provisions of recruitment rules.  \n 3. Establishment Division has also noticed that some Divisions/ Departments \nhave framed recruitment rules for isolated posts or very small cadres (comprising 3 -4 posts) \nlike telephone operators, lady health visito rs, teachers of departmental schools, etc. This is \nnot a satisfactory arrangement because such isolated posts or tiny cadres do not offer \nadequate prospects of promotion to the incumbents. In such cases, it would be advisable to \nfill the posts by having of ficials on deputation from departments which have large cadres \noperating in the relevant field, such as T&T Department*  in the case of telephone operators, \nFederal/ Provincial Health/Education Departments in the case of lady health visitors and \nteachers, etc. The Divisions/Departments are, therefore, advised not to frame separate \nrecruitment rules for their isolated posts or very small cadres where officials with requisite \nskills are available in other federal/provincial departments. The posts of the type under \nreference may be filled by deputation on tenure basis.  \n 4.  As a matter of general policy, a person below the age of 18 years cannot be \nemployed as a government servant. Other than this limitation, prescribing minimum age \nlimits for each post is not only unnecessary but leaves the possibility of denying opportunity \n                                                           \n* T&T Department **was converted into Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation Ltd. (PTCL) which has been \nprivatized as Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd. (PTCL) by the Government of Pakistan. However, \nthere is now National Telecommunication Corporation (NTC) for the telecommunication needs of \ngovernment.** [Erstwhil e] Telephone and Telegraph Department.  \nCHAPTER -3                            ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                              Page -115 \n \n to some otherwise qualified and capable candidates on a mere technicality. It has, therefore, \nbeen decided that, while framing recruitment rules, no conditions regarding minimum age be \nment ioned. In the existing cases, Ministries/Divisions may consider the matter and take steps \nto amend the rules, wherever necessary.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Div.‘s O.M.

It has also  been observed that the finalization of recruitment \nrules take considerable time and the F.P.S.C. do not entertain requisitions for regular \nappointments or proposals for first extension in ad -hoc appointments unless the rules \nhave been notified. This leads  to avoidable administrative complications besides causing \nfinancial hardship to the ad -hoc appointees. Ministries/Divisions are, therefore, advised \nto invariably draft their recruitment rules in the light of model rules already circulated \nand follow up th eir finalization/notification on top priority basis so that the time -lag is \nreduced to the barest minimum. Wherever necessary, Ministries/ Divisions may hold \njoint meetings with the Establishment Division/FPSC so as to eliminate delay in the \nfinalization o f the recruitment rules.  \n[Authority. – Estt.

DETERMINATION OF DOMICILE  \n 5.1 Determination of Domicile  \n Reference Establishment Division's O.M. No. 2/2/67 -D.V., dated the 26th August, \n1968. It has been observed that the instructions contained therein for determining the domicile \nof candidates while making appointment to posts are n ot being complied with faithfully in \nsome cases.  These instructions clearly provide that a candidate belonging to Pakistan by \norigin should be considered for appointment on the basis of domicile of his father. Similarly, a \nmigrant candidate should be cons idered only against the quota of the province/region where \nhis parents are domiciled and where they have resided for at least three years.  In case the \nparents of a migrant candidate have not migrated to Pakistan, he should be considered for \nappointment on  the basis of his own domicile.  All the Ministries/Divisions are requested that, \nwhile making ad -hoc appointments against the posts required to be filled through FPSC, they \nshould carefully examine the domicile of the candidates in the light of the above instructions. \nThis may also kindly be brought to the notice of all the departments/organizations under their \nadministrative control for strict compliance.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

The matter has, therefore, been reconsidered with a view to \nrationalizing the policy regarding determination of domicile of the candidates for \ngovernment s ervice, and the following revised orders are issued, in partial modification \nof the existing instructi ons:— \n(i) There should be no change in the policy regarding the persons belonging \nto Pakistan by origin, i.e., they should continue to be considered for \nappointment only against the quota of the province/region to which the \nfather of such a candidate belongs.  \n(ii) A migrant candidate, whether residing in Pakistan or abroad, should be \nconsidered for appointment only against the quota of the province/region \nwhere his parents are domiciled and where they have resided for at least 3 \nyears.  However, the condition of 3 years' residence should be deemed to \nbe fulfilled if the parents are officially domiciled in a particular \nprovince/region but have been living in  some other areas for a number of \nyears due to exigencies of service.

No.2/2/67 -DV, dated 26 -8-1968].  \n(ANNEX I)  \n(See 5.2 para 1)  \n[Copy of Estt. Div.‘s O.M.No.25/113/54 -SEI, dated the 4th January, 1956].  \n Provincial Quotas on the Basis of Domicile Certificates: The recruitment policy \nof government, according to which recruitment to the Central Services is made, is based \non a system of Provincial quotas.  These quotas were meant for candidates who belonged \nby origin to the provinces of Pakistan, or who, on migration from Indian provinces had \npermanently settled down in one of the Pakistan  Provinces.  However, by means of \ndomicile certificates, a large number of candidates who had come over from India but \nhad not permanently settled in any Pakistan Province were able to enter the *Central \nServices, thus shutting out candidates belonging by origin to Pakistan provinces from \ntheir due share in the administration of the country.  What these candidates did was to file \ndeclarations before District Magistrates, to the effect that they had renounced their \nprevious domicile and that they had resided  for over a year in such provinces as (East \nBengal), Sindh and the **N.W.F.P., where competitive conditions were comparatively \neasier.  Having obtained such certificates of domicile on the strength of these \ndeclarations, the veracity of which could seldom be properly checked, these candidates \nwould leave that particular province and have no further connection with it.  They would \nthen prepare themselves for examinations in areas where educational facilities were better \nbut, by virtue of their domicile certi ficates, they demanded to be considered for \nappointment against the quota of one of the above provinces in which they claimed to be \ndomiciled, provided, of course, that they had qualified in the examinations.  In actual \nfact, the Domicile Certificate merel y made a refugee candidate eligible for appearing in \nan examination for appointment to a post in Pakistan and did not confer any right on him \nto be appointed against the quota of a particular province.  \n 2.  In order to ensure that government's recruitment policy is properly carried \nout and that no candidate enters the *Central Services against the quota of a province \nwho does not belong to that province either by origin or through settling down \npermanently there, government consider it necessary to provide a check against the entry \ninto the Central* Services of candidates who claim to be considered against provincial \nquotas on spurious grounds.  It has, therefore, been decided that, in the case of candidates \nwho qualify for appointment to the *Central Servic es, but who do not belong, by origin, \nto any Pakistan province, they should be admitted against the quota of the province in \nwhich they claim to have settled permanently, provided there is proof of three years' \nresidence/ education in the province against whose quota they claim to be considered.  \n                                                           \n ‗Federal Services/Groups‘.  \n** Now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  \nCHAPTER -3                            ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                              Page -149 \n \n This can be established in most cases from educational certificates which the candidates \nwill file with their application.  In other cases, where a candidate has been educated in a \nprovince for a shorter period alt hough he claims to have resided there for 3 years, other \nevidence must be produced by the candidate to support his claim.  In the case, however, \nof a refugee candidate studying abroad, or in some parts of Pakistan other than the \nprovince against whose quot a he claims to be considered, the condition of three years' \nresidence in that Province should be deemed to be satisfied, if the parents of such a \ncandidate have resided in the Province in question for three years.  \n 3.  The decision outlined in the precedin g paragraph does not mean that \nrefugee candidates, who fail to prove their claim that they belong to a particular area, are \nshut out from appointments to the *Central Services.  As Ministries are aware, the \nrecruitment policy provides a 20% merit quota and  a refugee candidate, who does not \nsatisfy the above requirements, can take his chance in that quota.  Finally, it may be \nadded that, in the case of a candidate whose father belongs by birth or by origin to a \nPakistan province, it is immaterial where he ha s received his education or has resided. \nSuch a candidate will be considered, for appointment against the quota of vacancies \nreserved for that province without any check.  \n 4.  The above decision will not be affected by the coming into existence of \none prov ince in West Pakistan as no change in the existing recruitment policy is \ncontemplated. The recruitment policy in respect of services and posts under the *Central \nGovernment will continue to operate in those areas which constitute the previous \nProvinces and  which will now be expressed in terms of districts comprising those areas.  \n(ANNEX II)  \n(See 5.2, para 1)  \n [Copy of Establishment Division Office Memorandum No. 1/12/56 -R, dated \nthe 14th February, 1958].  \n Attention is invited to the Establishment Division Of fice Memorandum No. \n25/113/54 -SEI, dated the 4th January, 1956 in which instructions were issued that in the case \nof a refugee candidate studying abroad or in some parts of Pakistan other than the province \nagainst whose quota he claims to be considered, the conditions of three years' residence in that \nprovince should be deemed to be satisfied, if the parents of such a candidate have resided in \nthe province in question for three years.  It, therefore, follows by implication that in the case of \nthose candid ates, whose parents have acquired the domicile in a province/zone, but who, due \nto the exigencies of service, have been serving outside that province/zone, for a number of \nyears, the conditions of 3 years residence for that province (for the candidate) wil l be deemed \nto have been fulfilled for the purpose of being considered against the quota of that \nprovince/zone.  \n5.3 Married Female Candidates -  \nDetermination of Domicile   \n According to the decisions contained in the Est t. Division ‘s O.M No. \n2/2/67 -DV, dated   the 26th August, 1968, the domicile of a candidate is to be determined \n                                                           \n* Federal.  \nPage -150                             ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      CHAPTER -3 \n \n on the basis of the domicile of his or her parents and if the parents of a migrant candidate \nhave not migrated to Pakistan, on the basis of his or her own residence and education  in \nthe province in which he or she is domiciled. A question has arisen whether a female \nmarried candidate can be considered to have the same domicile as that of her husband.  \nThe matter has been considered and it has been decided that the domicile of a ma rried \nfemale candidate may be accepted to be the same as that of her husband for the purposes \nof direct recruitment.  \n [Authority: – Estt. Division‘s O.M.No.F.8/5/75 -WC, dated 12 -8-1975].  \n5.4 Candidates Not Required to Show Place of Birth  \nof their Fathers for Purposes of Domicile  \n As the Ministries/ Divisions are aware, the government observes provincial/  \nregional quotas in filling vacancies reserved for direct recruitment to posts under the \nFederal Government. It has been brought to the notice of the gover nment that candidates \nfor appointment to federal posts are sometimes required to state the place of birth of their \nfather.  This information is not relevant to the determination of domicile of a candidate. \nThe government have, therefore, decided that, in f uture, no candidate will be asked to \nstate the place of birth of his father. However, the requirement of stating the domicile of \nfather and other particulars like name, address etc., will continue to be observed as \nbefore.  \n 2. The Ministries/Divisions are requested to give wide publicity to these \ninstructions.  \n [Authority: – Estt. Div.‘s O.M.No.2/5/77/WC/R -IX, dated 11 -1-1978].  \n5.5 Change of Domicile After Entry  \ninto Government Service  \n A question has arisen whether a person who entered (into) government se rvice \non the basis of domicile of a particular province/ region of Pakistan can subsequently \nchange his domicile during his service.  As a citizen of Pakistan, a government servant \ncan change his domicile according to the law and the rules made thereunder.  It has, \nhowever, been decided that the domicile of a government servant as declared by him and \naccepted by government at the time of entry into government service should be treated as \nfinal throughout his service career and no subsequent change in his dom icile should be \nrecognized for the purpose of terms and conditions of his service including his allocation \nand liability to transfer.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

Sometimes, reports for \nseveral years are missing, making it difficult for the Commission to determine the \nsuitability of the officers concerned for the posts for which they are being considered. \nThe Commission, therefore, request the Ministries/Divisions to satisfy themselves th at \nCharacter Rolls are complete and up -to-date before sending them to the Commission.  \n2. The Ministries/Divisions and the Heads of the Departments should forward the \nCharacter Rolls as quickly as possible on demand by the Commission.  \n[Authority .- FPSC‘s O. M.No .F.16/17/53 -S, dated 24 -04-1953 &  FPSC‘s O.M.No.F.1/30/53 -R, \ndated 06-12-1956].  \n 7.8 Nomination of Departmental Representatives  \n  to Assist the Commission at the Interviews for  \n  Various Posts  \n The Federal Public Service Commission has observed that the government's \ninstructions are not being followed strictly by the Ministries/ Divisions/Departments \nwhile nominating Departmental Representatives to assist the Commission at the \ninterviews for recr uitment to various posts. The Commission has also noted with \nprofound regret that its requests to Ministries etc. concerned to nominate Departmental \nRepresentatives of relevant trades (subject wise) of sufficiently higher status i.e. not below the \nrank of Joint Secretary and or technical head of the line are not being complied with.  \n 2. Recently, during interviews of candidates for certain technical/ specialist \nposts, the Departmental Representatives deputed to assist the Commission were officers \nCHAPTER -3                            ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                              Page -261 \n \n on administrative side, who were not sufficiently senior in their own departments and/or \nqualified in technical line. In order to assess the professional competence of the \ncandidates properly and accurately, it is necessary that senior officers of technical \ndepartments with requisite qualifications are deputed by the Ministries/etc. to assist the \nCommission at the interviews for appointment to the scientific, technical and specialist \nposts. One of the drawbacks of government representation at junior level is o bvious from \nsome instances in which the Ministries/Divisions/Departments find it necessary to \nrepudiate the contribution made by their own representatives at the interviews, on the \ngrounds that they were not sufficiently experienced and, therefore, could n ot represent the \npoint of view of their Ministries/Divisions/Departments authoritatively.  \n 3. The Commission fully realises that, from the point of view of \nDepartmental Representatives, interviewing of candidates at the four normal centres viz: \nPeshawar, I slamabad, Lahore and Karachi, is a time consuming job, in order to finish one \ncomplete cycle for any appointment. For *Grade 18 and above posts, the Commission \ngenerally conducts interviews at one centre, but for others the Commission has to go to \neach place of interviews.  \n 4. In repeating its invitation to the Ministries etc. the Commission hopes \nearnestly that, at the interviews fixed by the Commission for selection of their candidates, \ntheir representation will invariably be not below the rank of Join t Secretary or head of \ntechnical department.  \n 5. In case of technical posts, the Commission would request that the heads of \ntechnical departments concerned should invariably be nominated for this purpose who \nwill take full responsibility for giving the vie ws of his department to the Commission. It \nis further requested that, as far as possible, the same representative should be deputed at \nall interview centres for a particular post, in order to ensure uniformity of standards. If \nthe Ministries/Divisions/Depa rtments are not in a position to nominate a suitable \nDepartmental Representative of the right status, then the Commission will do without \nhim and issue the recommendations for appointment without such help.  \n[Authority. - FPSC‘s O.M.No.F.1/20/80 -RIV, dated 1 9-4-1981].  \n7.9 Variation Between Views of Departmental  \nRepres entatives at the Interview and Commission's  \nAdvertisements for Various Posts  \n There have been some cases where Departmental Representatives have, before \nan interview, suggested that they choose person with a particular qualification. This \nparticular qualification has no particular emphasis in the advertisement and, therefore, it \nis grossly unfair on the candidates who come in response to that advertisement.  \n                                                           \n* BPS.  \nPage -262                             ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      CHAPTER -3 \n \n  2. [X  X X X X X] \n  3. As far as the Commission is concerned, it only relies on the recruitment rules. \nIt would be in the interest of departments to review their recruitment rul es so that there is no \nconflict between the recruitment rules and the Departmental Representatives. The \nCommission will, while taking the advice of the Departmental Representative, reserve the \nright to recommend only those who are in line and in accordance  with the advertisement.  \n[Authority .- Paras 1 & 3 of FPSC‘s letter No. F.1/35/78 -RIV  dated 29 -1-1979].  \n7.10 Criteria for Counting of Prescribed  \nLength of Experience for Recruitment  \nto Various Posts  \n  Attention is invited to the Establishment Division's O.M. No. 39/3/75 -DV (Pt), \ndated the 22nd October,  1976, and clause 'c' of para 19 of the ―INSTRUCTIONS TO \nCANDIDATES ‖. A copy of these instructions is duly supplied to the candidates \nalongwith the presc ribed application forms. In all the posts which are advertised by the \nCommission for selection on the basis of interview only, certain period of experience is \ngenerally prescribed for such posts, alongwith academic qualifications. In such cases, the \nCommis sion considers that experience relevant which is obtained after acquiring the \nminimum prescribed educational qualifications for the post. Experience obtained before \nacquiring the minimum prescribed educational qualification, even if it is of the same line,  \nis not taken into consideration.  \n 2. The above procedure has often resulted in the rejection of candidates who \nhappen to be the ad hoc incumbents of the post or employed in some other capacity in the \nsame department.  Applications of all the candidates ar e duly considered by the \nCommission but candidates who fall short of the required experience after the prescribed \nminimum academic qualifications are not called for interview. This results in the \nrepresentations from the candidates or even from the departm ents who are keenly \ninterested in the regularization of their ad hoc incumbents. The Establishment Division \nmemorandum referred to above and a copy of the `INSTRUCTIONS TO THE \nCANDIDATES' is, therefore, brought to the notice of the department to enable the m to \nknow the procedure being followed by the Commission for pre -selection of candidates \nfor interview, etc. For obvious reasons, the Commission cannot deviate from the \nprocedure once laid down and known to all.  \n 3. However, there may be cases in which exp erience gained before acquiring \nthe prescribed minimum educational qualifications may also be considered relevant by \nMinistries, etc. For example, for a medical post where post -graduate Diploma is \nprescribed as a minimum qualification, the experience gaine d after the Medical Degree \nbut before the Diploma is often considered as relevant if so prescribed in the \nCommission's advertisement.  \n 4. The Ministries/Divisions are, therefore, requested that wherever they \nconsider that the experience gained before acqui ring the minimum prescribed educational \nCHAPTER -3                            ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                              Page -263 \n \n qualification should also be accepted as relevant, this should be made clear while \nforwarding the requisitions for the posts and full justification may be given for providing \nthis relaxation in the interest of servic e. The departments will also be required to certify \nthat this relaxation of the general procedure had the approval of the Secretary of the \nMinistry/Division concerned. The Commission after due consideration of the proposal \nmay agree to advertise this condi tion in its advertisements, so that the candidates \nconcerned should know it before applying for the posts. Unless such a clearance is given in \nthe requisition for the posts concerned and advertised by the Commission accordingly, it will \nnot be possible for  the Commission to deviate from the general practice stated above.  \n[Authority .— FPSC‘s letter No.F.8/13/81 -S, dated 08 -7-1981].  \n 7.11 Re-allocation Against the Vacancies  \nCaused by Repeaters/Non -Joiners  \n In supersession of the Establishment Division‘s O.M  of even number dated 18th \nJune, 1990 on the above subject, it has been decided with the approval of the competent \nauthority that w.e.f.

Simultaneously, the allocation made by the FPSC will also be \nannounced  in all the leading newspapers with similar advice to the candidates.  \n b) In the second phase the vacancies occurring due to non -acceptance of offer \nwithin 15 days of the announcement will be reported to the FPSC for \ncompleting re -allocation before the co mmencement of the common training \nprogramme at the Civil Services Academy, Lahore. Any vacancy occurring \nafter the start of the common training will be carried over to the next \ncompetitive examination.  \n c) The announcement of initial allocation shall be made 45 days before the \nannouncement of common training at CSA to ensure timely completion of \nboth the phases indicated above.  \n [Authority .— Establishment Division‘s O.M No. 1/29/87 -T.V dated 19 -03-1991 ]. \n7.12 Withdrawal or Change of Requisition by the  \nAdministrative Ministries/ Divisions/Departments  \nfor Posts Already Advertised by the Commission  \n It has been decided that: — \n(i) The requests received from Ministries/Divisions, Departments for \nwithdrawal of case s wherein interviews have been started or nominations \nfinalized would not be accepted. The sponsoring Ministry/Division/ \nDepartment should appoint the Commission's nominees even if the \nabolished post(s) had to be revived.  \nPage -264                             ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      CHAPTER -3 \n \n (ii) Other requests for withdrawal of r equisitions would be entertained on the \nbasis of merit of each case if the prescribed procedure has been followed.  \n[Authority .- Para 4(i)&(ii) of Estt.

Instructions were also issued in 1964 for \naccording preference to released/reti red armed forces (Non - Commissioned) personnel \nfor employment in civil posts over candidates from the open market provided they \npossessed the educational and other qualifications and were otherwise suitable.  The \ninstructions provide that the maximum age limit may be relaxed up to a maximum of 10 \nyears or the number of years a person has actually served in the Armed Forces whichever \nPage -290                             ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      CHAPTER -3 \n \n is less.  In respect of Class IV jobs, and Class III posts of staff car drivers , the instructions \nprovide for reservation of 50% vacancies for ex -servicemen.  \n 2. The Ministry of Defence have reported that despite these instructions, the \nefforts of GHQ to provide employment for the maximum number of ex -servicemen have \nnot achieved the  desired result.  The above instructions are brought to the notice of all \nMinistries/Divisions, the Attached Departments and the Subordinate Offices with the \nrequest that all appointing authorities should ensure strict observance of these instructions \nso that the maximum possible number of ex -servicemen are absorbed in civil posts.  \n 3. There may also be vacancies both under the Federal Government and the \nProvincial Governments for which suitably -qualified and experienced candidates from the \nopen market may not be readily available. GHQ is of the view that released/retired armed \nforces personnel who are not only experienced, energetic, discipline and reliable but also \ndutiful and willing to work under abnormal conditions, can be suitably employed in the \nexisting vacancies.  It is, therefore, requested that vacancies for which suitable \ndepartmental/direct recruits are not available should be reported to the Ministry of Defence, \nRawalpindi, so that GHQ may be asked to provide a panel of suitable ex -servicemen fo r \nselection by the appointing authorities.  \n 4. The instructions in para 3 above do not apply to posts recruitment to \nwhich is required to be made, under the relevant rules, through the Federal Public Service \nCommission.  All vacancies in such posts should c ontinue to be reported to the \nCommission. The eligible ex-servicemen may apply direct to the Commission when the \nposts are advertised. However, the Ministries/Divisions and the various Departments \nunder them some time do make ad -hoc appointments against po sts which are normally \nrequired to be filled through the Federal Public Service Commission, subject to \nreplacement by the Federal Public Service Commission nominees and in accordance with \nthe instructions regarding ad -hoc appointments issued by Establishme nt Division from \ntime to time.  It is requested that particulars of vacancies which are intended to be filled \non ad -hoc basis, by appointment of persons not already serving in the department, may \nalso be communicated to Ministry of Defence.  The ex -service men, if appointed on ad -\nhoc basis, shall be subject to replacement by the F.P.S.C. nominees.  \n 5. It is also requested that suitable instructions may be issued by the \nMinistries/Divisions to the various autonomous bodies and semi -autonomous bodies \nunder the m to employ ex -servicemen in as large a number as possible and for this \npurpose, details of the posts and the qualifications and experience required may be \ncommunicated to Ministry of Defence so that names of suitable ex -serving officers and \nmen may be com municated to them for selection.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

It is well nigh impossible to complete the \nrequired formalities within such a short time.  \n 2.  In case the dema nd is large it would always be available for the \nrequisitioning departments to contact the Pakistan Armed Services Board and its subordinate \noffices at the provincial/district level, seek their advice and chalk out a coordinated plan for \nthe accomplishment  of the task.  \n 3.

Division‘s O.M.No.1/19/80 -IC-I,dated 4 -12-1980].  \n9.25 Extension in Re -employment on  \nContract of Armed Forces Officers  \n Attention is invited to the Establishment Division's Office Memorandum No. \n14/5/78 -D.III, dated 10th February, 1980, as amended from time to time. It is stated that \naccording to the existing instructions all cases of induction/ re -employment on contract of \nserving retired officers of the armed forces in civil posts are required to be processed \nthrough the Defence Services Officers' Selection Board. It has now been decided by the \nPrime Minister that cases of extension in contract re -employment should also be \nprocessed through the Board.  \n 2. Cases for extension in contract re -employment are placed before the Board \nafter obtaining a panel of two or more officers in each case from the Ministry of Defence. \nThe Board considers such cases i n the light of recommend ations of the administrative \nMinistries/Divisions/Departments, performance/ service record of the officer and \nexigencies of the service.  Recording of minutes of the meetings and completion of other \nformalities such as submission of  summaries to the Prime Minister and soliciting his \norders take sufficiently long time.  According to amended para-28 of the Policy vide \nEstablishment Division's Office Memorandum of even number dated 01-01-1987 if no \norders are received by the date on whi ch the contractual period expires, the contract is \ndeemed to have been terminated.  It is also not possible to convene the meetings of the \nBoard frequently and at a short notice.  \n 3. To ensure that cases of extension in contract re -employment are finalized  \nbefore the maturity of contract appointments, it is imperative that such cases should be \ninitiated well in advance.  \n 4. In view of the position explained above, all Ministries/ Divisions/  \nDepartments are advised to submit cases of extension in contract re -employment of \nretired officers of armed forces at least four months in advance of the date of expiry of \ncontract, to ensure timely decision.  \n [Authority: – Estt.

Recommendations of Departmental Committees \nconcerning promotions from Class II to Class I shall, also be subject to the approval of \nthe Federal Public Service Commission.  \n 3. The Committee to be established in each Ministry should consist of the \nSecretary or an officer nominated by him and at least two other officers who preferably \nshould be officers familiar with the work of candidates for promotion.  \n 4. It will be open to each Ministry to have more than one Committee for \ndealing with promotions to different categories of posts, e.g., one Committee for \npromot ion to posts of Superintendents and another for promotion to other posts.  Where \nseparate Committees are set up, it will be desirable to maintain liaison between them by \nhaving, for example, a common member.  \n 5. The Public Service Commission should be assoc iated with these \nCommittees to the greatest extent possible. The Commission should invariably be invited \nto depute a member to sit on all Committees dealing with promotions to and within any \nCentral Service, Class I. It may not be practicable for the Commi ssion, at any rate at \npresent, to be represented on all Committees in connection with promotions to and within \nthe Central Service, Class II, but the list of such services under the control of each \nMinistry should be examined in order to determine whether or not there are any services \nin making promotions to which it is particularly desirable to have the Commission \nrepresented in the relevant Committee.  \n 6. The promotions recommended will, to the extent desired by the Minister, \nbe subject to the approval of  the Minister in charge.  \n 7. The association of the Commission to the extent contemplated, with these \ndepartmental promotion Committees is not intended to remove the necessity for a formal \nreference of a proposal to the Commission in cases where the consul tation with the \nCommission is necessary under statutory rules.  \n 8. The Committees should follow the method of maintaining a list of persons \nfit for promotion and no departure from the order in that list should be made without the \nauthority of the Committee  provided that when the public interest demands an officer not \nin the list and not next in the order of the list may be appointed for a period not exceeding \nfour months. The list should be revised and brought up -to-date annually.  \n 9. As regards Class III s ervices, Ministries and Heads of Departments should \nconsider organizing Committees on such similar or other lines as might appear suitable to \nthem. It is left open to them to make their own arrangements in regard to Class III \nappointment.  \n 10. Ministries a re requested to proceed with the formation of Departmental \nPromotion Committees and to supply the Establishment with copies of relevant orders not \nlater than the end of February, 1948.  \n[Authority: – Establishment Division‘s Office Memo randum No. 33/1/47 -Ests-SE II, dated the 29th \nJanuary, 1948].  \n \n______________________________  \nCHAPTER 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPOINTMENTS  \n (309-310) \nCHAPTER -4                        ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                          Page - 311 \n CHAPTER 4  \nAPPOINTMENTS  \n  Sl. \nNo(s).

The Ministries/Divisions did not mention in their \nadvertisements that the candidates shall be entitled to 5 years relaxation in age over and \nabove the age limit prescribed in the Recruitment Rules. The Committee took serious \nview of this on part of the Departments due to which injustice could have been caused to \nthe people.  \n 2.  In light of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee, the \nMinistries/Divisions/Departments are advised that henceforth, the concession of 5 years \ngeneral relaxation in upper age limit shall be clubbed with the maximum age limit of the \npost in their advertisements. In case usual upper age limit of posts in various Basic Pay \nScales is as in column(2) below, the maximum  \nage limit shall be as in column (4) below: — \nBasic Pay Scale  Age Limit  General  \nAge Relaxation  Maximum Age \nLimit  \n(1) (2) (3) (4) \n1-15 25 years  + 5 years  30 years  \n16 28 years  + 5 years  33 years  \n17 30 years  + 5 years  35 years  \n18 35 years  + 5 years  40 years  \n19 40 years  + 5 years  45 years  \n20 45 years  + 5 years  50 years  \n21 50 years  + 5 years  55 years  \n \n 3.

In addition to above, the President/Prime Minister may, on extreme \ncompassionate grounds, grant age relaxation to an individual candidate for a period not \nexceeding three y ears. \n 5. Further, where the Ministries/Divisions/Departments have recently \nadvertised various posts and the candidates have appeared in written test but their interviews \nare yet to be held i.e. their selection process is not over, the said posts may be re -advertised \nfor additional applications with clear rule position about age limit and age relaxations as at \nparas 2 and 3 above.  \n 6. It may be added that the upper age limit relaxations mentioned at paras 2 and \n3 above have been provided in the Initial App ointment to Civil Posts (Relaxation of Upper \nage Limit) Rules,1993 which are not applicable for recruitment to posts to be filled through \nAnnual Competitive (CSS) Examination conducted by the FPSC.  \n 7. For recruitment to BS -17 posts to be filled through th e Annual Competitive \n(CSS) Examination, the upper age limit is presently 28 years which is relaxable by 2 years \nfor Government Servants, Armed Forces Personnel and other specified categories of \ncandidates.  \n 8.    The Ministries/Divisions are requested to s trictly observe the above \nmentioned instructions and also bring the same to the notice of the Departments/  \nOrganizations under their administrative control for strict compliance.    \n[Authority: - Establishment Division‘s O.M No.9/2/91 -R-5 dated 24 -06-2010.]  \n3.3 Relaxation in Upper Age Limit to Persons Employed  \nin Government Department on Contract Basis  \n Sub rule (iii) of rule 3 of Initial Appointment to Civil Posts (Relaxation of \nUpper Age Limit) Rules, 1993, notified vide SRO 1079(I)/93 dated 4th November, 1993 \nprovides *[15] years relaxation upto 55 years in the upper age limit prescribed in the \nrecruitment rules for Government Servants who have completed 02 years continuous \ngovernment service on the closing date for receipt of applications.  \n 2.

Queries \nhave been received as to the definition of the word ―place ‖ and ―organi zation ‖. \n 2.  The matter has been considered.  The word ―place ‖ refers to the area in \nwhich the office in which the vacancy has arisen is located, e.g., Rawalpindi, Islamabad, \nKarachi etc. The word ―organization ‖ refers to each distinctive administrative unit of \ndepartm ent.  For instance in a Division which is divided into different Wings each as a \ndistinct entity, the organization will refer to each such Wing.  \n [Authority: – Estt. Division‘s O.M.

No. 1/21/76 -AR.I/R.II, dated \nthe 18th June, 1980 as amended vide Establishment Division O.M. of 10th April, 1981 a \nquestion has been raised as to which authority is competent to extend current charge \nappointment beyond 6 months.  \n 2.

No. \n1/21/76 - AR.I/R.II, dated the 18th June, 1980 as amended vide O.M. dated 10th April, \n1981 is in partial modification of the Establishment Division O.M. No . 7/22/70 -AVII, \ndated 7th  August, 1970.  The cases of extension of current charge appointment beyond 6 \nmonths will, therefore, continue to be sanctioned by the Establishment Secretary in respect of \nposts in BPS 17 to 19 and by the President in respect of posts in  BPS 20 and above.  \n 3. The current charge arrangement is made as a temporary measure pending \nappointment of a person to the post on a regular basis.  It is expected that the case for regular \nappointment will be simultaneously initiated and finalised within the period of 6 months \nwhich is considered sufficient for the purpose. Normally, therefore, there should be no \noccasion for extending current charge arrangement beyond 6 months. In those cases only \nwhere it is necessary to co ntinue the current charge arrangement beyond this period cases, \nshould be referred to the Establishment Division.  Such cases should indeed the rare.

While issuing formal sanction for  grant of additional remuneration on \naccount of current charge, it may be specifically certified that the above mentioned guidelines \nhave been kept in view while approving/extending current charge arrangement.  \n[Authority: Estab.

H owever, in those cases where a vacancy in higher posts \noccurs for less than two months and it is considered impossible for good reasons to make \narrangements for day to day work of that post to be carried on otherwise, the duties of \nthat post may be given t emporarily with the approval of Authority competent to make \nappointments to the said posts, to the senior most officer in the cadre present at the place \nor in the organization where the vacancy may have occurred, if he is otherwise fit and \neligible for pro motion. In order to overcome the difficulties, authorities competent to \napprove such arrangements from BS -17 to BS -20 have also been prescribed. The above \nreferred instructions also provide that the said arrangements should not be made for a \nperiod of less  than one month and should not exceed three months.

The matter has been \nconsidered in consult ation with the Establishment Division. The position is that the \ncombination of charge in the above category of cases [unlike the combination of \nappointments under F. R. 49 or under para 1(2) (c) of the pre -Independence Government of \nIndia, Finance Departme nt's O.M.

It has accordingly been held that notification, in the \ngazet te, of the combination of charges authorised under para 2(ii) of the above mentioned \ncircular dated 9 -9-1971, would be uncalled for.  \n 2. It follows that in cases of the kind referred to in the preceding para, issue of \nan official letter conveying the appro val of the competent authority to the combination of \ncharges in question and to the grant of special pay in accordance with para 2(ii) of the \ncircular dated 9 -9-1971 referred to above, would constitute sufficient  authority for the Audit \nto allow the releva nt rate of special pay to the officer concerned.  \n[Authority: Finance Division‘s O.M.No.D.907 -R.4/76 -F.4 (19)R.1/76, dated 6 -10-1976].  \nCHAPTER -04                       ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                     Page - 381 \n \n  5.14 Appointment on Acting Charge Basis  \n Reference rule 8 -A of the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) \nRules, 1973, and to state that a civil servant, on appointment to hold a post on Acting \nCharge basis, shall – \n (a) assume full duties and responsibility of the post and exercise all statutory, \nadministrative and financial powers vested in the regular incum bent of the \npost; and  \n (b) during the period of such appointment, be entitled to draw fixed pay equal to \nthe minimum stage of the pay at which his pay would have been fixed, had \nhe been appointed to that post on regular basis.

In this context it is clarified that there is no provision of look after charge in \nCivil Servants Act,1973 and Rules made thereunder, rather an officer can be deputed \ntemporarily as an internal arrangement to look after the work of another post for disposa l \nof day to day work of urgent and routine nature in the Ministry/Division/Organization \nconcerned.  \n3. As a matter of principle, the senior most officer is normally asked by the head \nof the Division/Department to look after the work of a post when its incu mbent is \ntemporarily away. Regarding the decision making process, there may be certain issues \nwhich are of quasi -judicial nature and decision cannot be taken by an officer not \nformally designated to exercise those powers. Likewise, certain financial and \nadministrative powers can only be exercised by an officer to whom additional/current \ncharge of the post is entrusted in the prescribed manner. An officer looking after the \nwork cannot exercise such powers as he has not been delegated with such powers by the \ncompetent authority. As regards day to day decisions, these can be taken by an officer \nlooking after the work and can also be reviewed/revised by the head of the Organization \ndepending upon the merit of the case.  \n4. Ministries/Divisions are requested to d isseminate the above position to all the \nDepartments/Offices under their administrative control.  \n[Authority. — Establishment Division‘s O.M No. 3/15/2016 -R-II dated 09 -04-2021]  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCHAPTER -04                       ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                     Page - 383 \n \n V.

In accordance with Part IV dealing with ad -hoc and temporary \nappointments , rule 19 lays down that the post shall be advertised and the same procedure \nas laid down for the initial appointment in Part III shall be followed for making ad -hoc \nappointments.  \n   3. A number of cases have come to notice where ad -hoc appointments have \nbeen made from amongst departmental candidates or from other applicants without an \nadvertisement having been made in the press.  \n 4. This is irregular in future, no proposal for ad -hoc appointments will be \nentertained unless the post has been duly advertised .  The summary of the case submitted \nto the Establishment Division should invariably state that the post has been advertised \nand the clipping of the advertisement should be enclosed with the summary.  \n [Authority: – Estt.

No. 2/23/78 -D.III, d ated 17 -4-1978].  \n6.2 Ad-Hoc Appointees to be Clearly Told of the  \nConditions of Their Appointments  \n It has been noticed that various Ministries/Divisions etc. while advertising \nposts, falling within the purview of the FPSC, for purposes of making ad -hoc \nappointments thereto, do not take into account the fact that the appointees on the basis of \nsuch advertisements, being replaceable by the FPSC nominees, should be clearly told of \nthis condition of their appointments.  This omission on the part of various M inistries/ \nDivisions, etc. may give rise to complications later on.  \n 2. It is, therefore, requested that, while advertising for ad -hoc appointments \nto such posts, the Ministries/Divisions etc. should categorically state that the candidates \nappointed on the  basis of such advertisements will be replaceable by the FPSC \nnominees.  The condition may also be communicated to the candidates in the letters/  \nnotifications of such appointments so that no appointee claims regular appointment \nsubsequently on the basis of  advertisement or appointment letters/notifications.  \n 3. It may also be ensured that requisition for such posts should invariably be \nsent to the Commission within two months of the filling up of such posts on ad -hoc basis.  \n [Authority: – Estt. Division‘s O. M.No.2/6/74 -F.IV, dated 14 -6-1974].  \n6.3 Proposals for Continuance of  \nAd-Hoc Appointments  \n It has been observed that placing of requisitions on the Federal Public Service \nCommission in respect of posts required to be filled through the Commission are delayed \nby the Ministries/Divisions without any justification and ad -hoc appointments made on \nsuch posts are continued for long periods.  \nPage - 384                      ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      CHAPTER -04                         \n  2. In this connection, attention is invited to Rule 18 of the Civil Servants \n(Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rul es, 1973, which requires that a requisition in \nthe prescribed form shall be forwarded to the Federal Public Service Commission \nimmediately when it is decided to fill the post in question or, if that is not practicable and \nthe post is filled on ad -hoc basis , within two months of the filling of the post.  \n 3. It is, therefore, reiterated that while making ad -hoc appointments against \nposts falling within the purview of the Federal Public Service Commission, a requisition \nshould be placed on the Commission immed iately and in any case not later than two \nmonths from the date of filling the post on ad -hoc basis.  All proposals relating to ad -hoc \nappointments and their further continuance should, in future be accompanied by a copy \nof the requisition sent to the Commis sion as far as possible, otherwise the Establishment \nDivision may not consider such proposals.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

These instructions clearly pro vide for making ad -hoc appointment for a period \nnot exceeding six months with the approval of competent authority as laid down under \nrule 6 of the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rules, 1973, as \namended.  The first extension beyond the  initial period of ad -hoc appointment is required \nto be given after obtaining approval of the FPSC. As such, the approval of the competent \nauthority for this extension is not required.  Subsequent extensions for periods not \nexceeding six months in the ad -hoc appointment shall not require concurrence of the \nFPSC but approval of competent authority shall, in any case, be obtained.

It has, however, been noticed that proposals for ad -hoc \nappointments, which have considerably increased of late, are not submitted in \naccordance with the instructions laid down therein.  Ad -hoc appointments are to be made \nonly in cases of extreme urgency. But non -adherence to the prescribed procedure leads to \ndelay in their finalization. It is, therefore, reiterated that – \n(i) the device of ad -hoc appointment should be resorted to only in cases of \ngenuine urgency;  \n(ii) the post should be widely advertised/circulated;  \n(iii) regional/provincial quotas should be strictly observed; and  \nCHAPTER -04                       ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                     Page - 385 \n \n (iv) particulars of all the applicants should be sent alongwith detailed reasons \nwhy the person recommended has been selected.  \n 2.  Cases where the above procedure has not been followed will have to be \nreturned to the Ministries un -disposed of.  \n [Authority: – Estt. Division‘s d.o. letter No.4/20/74 -A.IV, dated 9-4-1977].  \n6.6 Seniority of Ad-Hoc Appointees for Purposes of Reversion or \nTermination of Services on Availability of Regular Appointees  \n No rules or instructions regarding determination of the seniority of ad -hoc \nappointees have so far been issued.  This is due to the fact that ad -hoc service does not \nreckon for purposes of seniority when the ad -hoc appointment is later on converted to \nregular appointment. Instructions have also been issued in Establishment Division's O.M. \nNo. 3/29/70 -D- III, dated the 7th January, 1971 that ad -hoc appointees should not be \npromoted to a higher grade. The question of determination of the seniority of the ad -\nhoc appointees for purposes of promotion, therefore, does not arise.  However, \nsometimes the question which does arise  is as to which one of the several ad -hoc \nappointees should be reverted when the F.P.S.C. qualified candidates become available. \nIt has been decided that reversion should be made in the reverse order of ad -hoc \nappointment.  However, when the date of ad -hoc appointment of more than one officer is \none and the same, the reversion should be made in the reverse order of the seniority in \nthe lower grade if available, otherwise the younger in age should revert first.  Reversion \nfor the purposes of this O.M. includ es termination of service where the ad -hoc appointee \nwas recruited directly from outside.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

RE-APPOINTMENTS  \n 7.1 Re-appointment to Grade 17 or Above Posts  \n It appears that some doubt still exists in some quarters about the procedure to be \nfollowed in the following cases: - \n(a) In case of re -appointment to a post in *Grade 17 or above of an officer whose \n―first appointment ‖ to a post in *Grade 17 or above was made with the app roval \nof the [President/ Prime Minister ]. \n(b) In case of appointment to hold full charge of a post in  *Grade 17 or above, \nof an officer who had already been holding current charge of the post.  \n 2.  The approval of the **[President/Prime Minister ] is not necessary for \nre-appointment of an officer to a post in *Grade 17 or above whose earlier appointment to \nthat post was made with the approval of the **[President/ Prime Minister ] and who was \nsubsequently reverted from that post due to no fault of hi s own.  However, where reversion \nwas made as a result of some disciplinary action, fresh approval of the **[President/Prime \nMinister ] would be necessary, if the officer is subsequently re -promoted to a post in *Grade \n17 or above.  \n 3. When an officer is app ointed to hold current charge of a post in *Grade 17 or \nabove with the approval of the President/ Prime Minister, similar approval of the \n**[President/Prime Minister ] is required when the same officer is appointed to hold full \ncharge of the post.  \n[Authorit y:– Estt. Division‘s O.M.No.10/2/64 -D.I, dated 13 -8-1964, as amended  \nvide O.M. No.3/20/70 -D.III, dated 16 -9-1970].  \n 7.2 Re-appointment to Posts and  \nSelection Board  \n In continuation of the instructions issued in the Establishment Division Office \nMemorandum No. 3/20/70 -D III, dated the 16th September, 1970 it has been decided that if \nthe re -appointment of an officer to a post in *Grade 17 and above took place after more than \none year of the reversion from that post, the case should be placed before the Central \nSelection Board for determining the continued fitness of the officer to hold a post in *Grade \n17 or above.  After the appro val of the Central Selection Board, it would not be necessary to \nrefer the case to the **[President/ Prime Minister ] again.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Division‘s O.M.No.3/20/70 -D.III, dated 16 -9-1971].  \n 7.3 Appointment of Secretaries to Government  \n Appointment of Secretaries/Acting Secretaries to the Government are made on the \nrecommendation of the Ministers concerned with the approval of the President.  There are, \n                                                           \n BPS.  \nNote Below: — \n Now appointing authorities may be seen in light of Rule -6 of APT Rules,1973.  \nCHAPTER -04                       ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                     Page - 387 \n \n however, standing instructions on the subject as contained in the Establishment Division \nOffice Memora ndum No. 33 (3)/54 -SEI, dated the 29th September, 1954.  \n 2. In terms of the Office Memorandum mentioned above, before any \nappointment of Secretary/Acting Secretary is decided upon, the Establishment Division \nshould be required to submit a factual note abou t possible candidates, covering such matters \nas service, eligibility, tenure, etc., together with their Character Rolls.  In practice, however, \nMinisters tend to make these appointments without consulting the Establishment Division.  \nThe President has, therefore, been pleased to observe that it is very necessary to follow the \nprocedure laid down in this respect.   \n 3. It has been decided that henceforth all notifications relating to appointments \nof Secretaries/Acting Secretaries shall be i ssued by the Establishment Division instead of the \nMinistries, as has been the practice so far. This course is necessary to avoid notifications \nbeing found legally or otherwise defective, as has been found to be the case in some \ninstances. In order to enab le this Division to issue the necessary notification, Ministries will \nsend the file to the Establishment Division after Prime Minister's orders have been obtained \nregarding such appointments.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Secretary's d.o. letter No.26(10)/63 -AI, date d 31-8-1963 and Estt. Secretary's d.o. \nletter No.26(19)/63 -A. 1, dated 31 -8-1963].  \n7.4 Notifications Regarding Postings,  \nTransfers etc. of Officers of the Status  \nof Joint Secretary and Above  \n It has been noticed by the Establishment Division that Ministr ies/ Divisions are not \nfully aware of the correct procedure with regard to obtaining orders for appointment to posts \nin the Ministries/Divisions and issue of notifications in respect of appointments to such posts.  \nThe correct procedure in this regard has,  therefore, been explained in the following \nparagraphs.  \n 2.  According to the existing instructions, appointments to the grade of Secretary, \nAdditional Secretary, Acting Secretary and Joint Secretary fall under the purview of the High \nLevel Selection Board  while appointments to the posts of Deputy Secretary to the \nGovernment of Pakistan [........] come within the scope of the Central Selection Board. The \nrecommendation of the High Power Selection Board/Central Selection Board in respect of \nthese officers have to be obtained by the Establishment Division. Thereafter, action is \nrequired to be taken in the following sequence: - \n (i) Approval of the President to the recommendation of the appropriate \nSelection Board.  \n (ii) (a)  Decision in the Establishment D ivision in consultation with \nMinistries/Divisions to post an approved officer to a particular post, \nand \n                                                           \n Now Prime Minister.  \n The word ‘Section Officer’ omitted.  \n Note: - The Prime Minister is now the appointing authority for posts in BPS 20 and above vide rule 6 of the \nCivil Servants (Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rules, 1973.  \nPage - 388                      ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      CHAPTER -04                         \n   (b)  Submission of a summary to the President for his specific approval \n to such appointment.  \n (iii) Issue of notification by the Establishment Divis ion making the actual \nappointment.  \n (iv) Issue of notification by the Ministries/Divisions concerned regarding \nassumption of charge of the particular post by the selected officer.  \n 3.  Action with regard to (i) and (iii) above is required to be taken by th e \nEstablishment Division alone.  Approval of the President to the appointment of a particular \nofficer to a particular post is at present taken by the administrative Division in which the \nvacancy exists. This has led to some unforeseen and unhappy consequen ces, e.g., \nunwillingness of the administrative Divisions to accept particular officers and allowing the \nofficers to assume charge of their duties before a formal notification has been issued by the \nEstablishment Division.  In order to avoid such difficulti es, it has now been decided that \napproval of the *President to all Secretariat appointments would be taken by the \nEstablishment Division, in consultation with the Ministries/Divisions.  \n 4.  The next step would be to issue a further notification regarding a ssumption \nof charge of the particular post by the selected officer. This notification is to be issued by the \nMinistries/ Divisions concerned. It is, however, emphasised that assumption of charge by \nthe selected officer cannot be from a date prior to but su bsequent to the date of notification \nregarding his appointment by the Establishment Division. In no case can the selected officer \nassume charge from a date earlier than the date of notification issued by the Establishment \nDivision.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

MANNER OF SUBMISSION OF CASES  \n 8.1 Manner of Submission of Cases  \nto the Establishment Minister  \n The summaries for the Establishment Minister received from the Ministries/  \nDivisions are found deficient in many respects and do not always contain all the relevant \ninformation which has, therefore, to be obtained formally or informally resulting in delays \nand loss of time.  It is, therefore, requested that Summaries for the Establishment Minister* or \npapers for Central Selection Board seeking approval to an appointment by promotion, direct \nrecruitment, transfer or re -employment, etc. may kindly be prepared in the following \nmanner: - \n(i) The subject should be stated in concise and self -explanatory manner.  \n(ii) The Summary should begin by indicating the number of vacancies and how \nthey have arisen.  \n(iii) It should then state how these vacancies have to be filled in under the \nrelevant recruitment rules i.e. whether they are to be filled directly, by \npromotion or b y transfer etc. If they are to be filled directly the regional/ \nprovincial quota to which they belong may be specifically indicated.  \n(iv) In any case, the qualifications and conditions of eligibility for appointment \nprescribed in the recruitment rules shou ld be stated either in the Summary or \nin the Annex  thereto.  If necessary, a copy of the recruitment rules may be \nenclosed.  \n(v) The Summary must also indicate the action taken to fill the vacancy viz. \nwhether the post has been notified to F.P.S.C. or direc tly advertised for ad -\nhoc appointment etc. and whether F.P.S.C./ Departmental Selection \nCommittee have recommended any candidate. In the case of promotions, the \nfact that D.P.C. or the C.S.B., as the case may be, has approved the \npromotion should be stated  alongwith the minutes.  \n (vi) Full information as to qualifications, experience etc. of candidates \nrecommended for appointment/ promotion/ transfer should be given \nalongwith clear indication of their place in the seniority list.  The candidate's \ndomicile s hould be precisely stated.  Where proposed promotion would \ninvolve supersession, detailed justification thereto may be given alongwith \nnames etc. of all the eligible candidates and their C.Rs in order of seniority \nincluding those who are proposed to be pas sed over.  Otherwise a clear \ncertificate may be given that no supersession is involved.  \n 2. It is requested that the Summaries may please be typed in double space on \nSummary paper and henceforth two copies of each Summary (alongwith enclosures) should \nbe invariably sent to the Establishment Division so that the original is returned with the \norders of the Establishment Minister and the duplicate retained in the Establishment \nDivision for record.  \n                                                           \n Cases are, at present, submitted by the Establishment Division to the Prime Minister.  \nPage - 390                      ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      CHAPTER -04                         \n  3.

The classification of posts into gazetted and non -gazetted has also \nbeen abolished.  However, the practice of notifying all appointments to Basic Pay Scales 16 \nand above in the  Gazette will continue to be followed.  \n *2. The appointments to the upgraded posts of *Stenographer (BPS 16) in \nAttached Departments are permitted to be notified in the official Gazette.  \n[Authority: – Para 2 of Estt.

No. 22/25/68 -AI, dated the 23rd January, 1969 \n, it was emphasized that t he charge of a particular post could be assumed by a government \nservant, duly approved by the competent authority only from a date subsequent to the date on \nwhich the notification of his appointment was issued by the Establishment Division, and that \nin no case the government servant could assume charge from a date earlier than the date of \nnotification issued by the Establishment Division, unless specifically stated.  \n 2. It has been noticed that the instructions referred to above have not been \nobserved in a number of cases by the Ministries/ Divisions and, in some cases government \nservants were allowed to assume charge of the posts to which they were appointed by the \nEstablishment Division, with effect from dates earlier than the dates of the notifications of  \ntheir appointments issued by the Establishment Division.  In view of this, it is considered \nnecessary to reiterate the position stated in para 1 above.  The fact that vacancies were \navailable in certain cases from back dates, is not relevant, and no gover nment servant can be \nallowed to assume charge of a higher post retrospectively only for that reason.  Further, in \norder to regularise the position, it is requested that all such cases should be reviewed and \nrelevant notifications, if any, which may have be en issued by the Ministries/Divisions in \ncontravention of the instructions referred to above, should be cancelled immediately, and \nrevised notifications issued, under intimation to the Establishment Division.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

SHORT TERM APPOINTMENTS  \n 10.1 Other Short -Term Appointments  \n Temporary vacancies upto two months or more. – Orders were issued (vide \nEstablishment Division Memorandum No. 54/27/ 53 -ME, dated the 30th September, 1953 \nand 14th November, 1953) to the effect that: - \n (i) No vacancy less than 4 months' duration should be filled;  \n (ii) Vacancies exceeding 4 months should not normally be filled but may be \nfilled under the personal orders of the Heads of Ministries/ Divisions/  \nDepartme nts; \n (iii) Exception from (i) and (ii) above may be made in the case of technical staff.  \n 2.  The question of filling of short -term vacancies has been considered further \nand it has since been decided, in supersession of the orders referred to above, that : \n(i) No vacancy upto 2 months should be filled;  \n (ii) Vacancies exceeding 2 months should not normally be filled but may be \nfilled under the personal orders of the Heads of Ministries/ \nDivisions/Departments;  \n (iii) In case where the nature of work is such that the employment of staff for a \nshort period is unavoidable in the interest of essential work, relaxation in \nrespect of promotion or recruitment to vacancies of even less than 2 months \nduration should be made and such vacancies should be filled under th e \npersonal orders of the Heads of Ministries/Divisions/ Departments. Such \nrelaxation should, however, be made only after consultation with the \nEstablishment Division.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Division‘s O.M. No. 54/27/53 -ME, dated 8 -4-1954 as amended  \nvide O.M.

The matter has been examined and the following instructio ns are issued for \nthe guidance of Ministries/Divisions, etc.:- \n (1) When the officer hands over charge of his post. - The officer concerned is \nplaced on special duty and is entirely detached from duties of the post which \nhe ordinarily holds. A post of Offic er on Special Duty would have to be \ncreated in the Ministry sponsoring his deputation and the vacancy created in \nhis own Ministry can be filled up in the normal course.  \n (2) When the officer does not hand over charge of his post. - The officer is not \ndetach ed from the duties of his post and it is not necessary to make  \narrangements for the disposal of the work relating to the post due to the \nabsence of its incumbent.  A new post in a lower BPS may be created  with \nCHAPTER -04                       ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      Page - 401 \n \n the sanction of the authority competent to cre ate such lower post for the \nperiod of the officer's absence on duty.  \n 2.

It has been decided that, though a vacancy \ncaused by suspension of an officer cannot be filled up substantively, it can be filled up on an \nofficiating basis, and that no supernumerary post ne ed be created in such case.  \n 2.  This supersedes Establishment Division's O.M. No. 2/14/67 -CIII dated the \n19th September, 1968.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Division‘s O.M. No. 6/2/71 -DI, dated 20 -9-1971].  \n 10.4 Procedure for Creation of Posts of  \nOfficer on Special Duty (O.S.D.) and  \nMaking Appointments Thereto  \n A question had arisen whether a procedure should be laid down for creation of \nposts of O.S.D. and making appointments to such posts. The posts of O.S.D. may be created \nfor the following rea sons: — \n (1) Government servants (member of a regularly constituted service or \notherwise permanent) waiting for posting orders.  \n         (2)  Deputation of a government servant (member of a regularly constituted \n*service  or otherwise deputed) for duty or  course of instruction or training in \nPakistan or training abroad, for a period exceeding two months, in \naccordance with the instructions contained in the Ministry of Finance \nO.M.No.3005 -EGI/52, dated 7 -5-1952. ( Annex ) \n (3) For doing work of a special natu re, e.g. examination and/or implementation \nof reports of Commissions/ Committees etc. \n (4) For overcoming technical difficulties.   \n 2.  In all such cases, concurrence of the Ministry of Finance/ Financial Adviser \nconcerned will be necessary before the posts are created.  \n                                                           \n or ‘group’.  \n Amended vide Estt.

As to the question of appointment to such posts, the matter has been \nconsidered in consultation with the Federal Public Service Commission and it has been \ndecided that Establishment Division and the Commission need not be consulted in regard to \nappointment to the posts created for the reasons stated at para (1) and (2) above.  \n 4.  In regard to posts created for the reasons stated at para 1 (3) and (4) above, it \nhas been decided that such posts may be filled by suitable officers eithe r by transfer or by \npromotion or by direct recruitment on the recommendation of the authority concerned.  \n 5.  It has also been decided that the Establishment Division should be consulted \nbefore the Ministry of Finance are approached for creating a post of O.S.D. for the reasons \nstated at (4) above.  \n 6.  Apart from the cases as mentioned above, there may be instances in which a \ntemporary government servant holding the post of O.S.D. may be sent for duty/training \nabroad. It has been decided that in such cases  if the temporary government servant is holding \nthe post with the approval of the Federal Public Service Commission or the Selection Board, \nno consultation will be necessary either with the Commission or the Establishment Division in \nthe case of deputation  for duty, but in the case of deputation for training the Establishment \nDivision should be consulted. In the case of officers appointed without consultation with the \nCommission or Selection Board, the Establishment Division and the Commission both should \nbe consulted before any such officer is deputed for duty or training abroad.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

A post of Officer on Special Duty would have to \nbe created in the Ministry sponsoring his deputation and the vacancy created \nin his own Ministry can be filled up in the normal course.  \n(2) When t he officer does not hand over charge of his post. - The officer is not \ndetached from the duties of his post and it is not necessary to create a \ntemporary post.

APPOINTMENT OF CONSULTANTS  \n 11.1 Re-employment of Consultant  \n  After the Age of Superannuation  \n Reference the guidelines regulating the appointment of Consultants in Ministries/  \nDivisions and Organizations under their administrative control providing inter alia,  the \nfollowing, vide para 8(i) issued under U.O. No. 11 -3/2001 -MSW -III, dated 25 -1-2002: — \n―8 (i) Engagement of retired officers as Consultants/Advisers etc. shall require \nprior permission of the government, invariably i.e. \nEstablishment Division  in case of retired civilian officers;  \nDefence Division  in case of retired defence officers; and  \nLaw,  Justice and Human Rights Division/Supreme Court/  \nHigh Courts in case of retired judiciary officers.  \n 2. On the other hand instructions contained in Establishment Secretary d.o. \nNo. 5/21/80 -A.III/D.4/D.5, dated 18.12.1985 issued with the approval of the Pr ime \nMinister provide that consultancies granted after the age of superannuation will be treated \nas re -employment and will be subject to the same rules as are applicable to re -\nemployment after superannuation.  \n 3.  With a view to drawing a distinction betwee n the consultancies offered to \nretired officers only to re -employ them after superannuation and those retired/  \nsuperannuated officers who qualify for consultancy through open competition and are \noffered perks, privileges (package) laid down for that positi on, a Summary was submitted \nto the Prime Minister for approval of suitable modifications/clarifications to the \ninstructions contained in Establishment Secretary‘s d.o letter No. 5/21/80 -A.III/D.2/  D.5 \ndated 18 -12-1985. The Prime Minister has been pleased t o approve that the re -\nemployment rules should apply to those government servants who are appointed on \ncontract as Consultants or otherwise after superannuation without open competition. On \nthe other hand, those retired government servants who compete with others in the private \nsector for a consultancy position on the basis of open competition and are selected on \nmerit should be entitled to the package, perks and privileges laid down for that position. \nThe contract offered without competition and open merit be governed by re -employment \nrules while consultants selected on the basis of open competition and merit be offered the \nrelevant package, which the position carries.  \n 4.  Ministries/Divisions are requested to follow the above instructions and \nalso bring th em to the notice of the Attached Departments, Subordinate Offices, \nAutonomous Bodies/Semi -Autonomous Bodies, Corporations Regulatory Authorities etc. \nunder their administrative  control for compliance.  \n \n[Authority: – Establishment Division‘s No. 10/67/2004 -R.2, dated 21st  June, 2005]  \n \nCHAPTER -04                       ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      Page - 405 \n \n  11.2 Submission of Panels for Nomination  \nby the Prime Minister  \n Refer the subject noted above and to state that the Prime Minister has observed \nthat Ministries/Divisions while proposing names for certain positions requiring approval \nof the Prime Minister have not been proposing appropriately considered panels for \nselec tion. In some cases, single nomination are made, while in other, those recommended \nhave no relevance to the job or organizations for which they are being proposed.  \n2. The Prime Minister has desired that, in future, the Ministries/Divisions \nshall ensure th e following: — \n \ni) A panel consisting of minimum three people shall be proposed for one \nposition, without fail. Establishment and Cabinet Divisions shall not process \nany case for approval of the Prime Minister where panel consists of less \nthan three nomination s; and,  \nii) The Administrative Secretary concerned shall be responsible for ensuring \n that CV of the proposed person provides adequate justification for his \n nomination for that assignment.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Division‘s O.M No. 52/02/2016 -E-1, dated 22 -09-2016].  \n 11.3 Guidelines for Appointment of Consultants  \n Consequent upon the findings of various Committees appointed during 2001 to \nexamine the appointments of consultants and deliberations of the Conference held on 13 \nNovember, 2001, under the Chairmanship of the COS to the Chief Executive, the competent \nauthority was pleased to direct , inter alia , that guidelines regulating the appointment of \nconsultants in all Ministries/Divisions and organizations under th eir administrative control, be \nframed/ circulated on the approved lines, for compliance by all the Ministries/ Divisions/  \nOrganizations. Accordingly, a set of guidelines, in the succeeding paragraphs, is circulated for \nstrict compliance, to ensure  that  the  best  persons  are transparently and competitively \nappointed in a cost -effective manner, only when a consciously and formally identified need \nfor consultants exists.  \n Determination of Need for Consultants:  \n 2. Need identification is a pre -requisite fo r any organization planning to \nobtain services of consultants, who are normally required to tender advice, being \nexperts/specialists, on specific (generally technical) issues/projects to:  \n(a) Address on uncommon problems;  \n(b) Provide technical supervisions; or  \n(c) Introduce innovative practices/solutions  \n Consultancies would generally fall into two broad categories:  \n(i) Project Consultancy – to provide technical support/ supervision by filling \nvacuum of technical expertise, specific to the project and funded out of \nPage - 406                     ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                       CHAPTER -04 \n \n development funds; and  \n(ii) General/Management Consultancy – to provide expert advice, unavailable \nin-house, to introduce innovative solutions to financial/human resources \nmanagement/ technical issues or to act as agents of change for status -quo \noriented permane nt employees and commonly paid for out of non -\ndevelopment budget.  \n A consultancy would, therefore, always be assignment specific and time bound \nand should be preferred only when it is considered value effective to hire services of a \nconsultant compared to developing in -house expertise.  \n 3. As a first step, the client organization is required to ascertain as to whether \nor not the required expertise is available within the organization/ govern ment. In case the \nexpertise is available in -house, reasons for not undertaking the assignment internally may \nbe spelled out and detailed justification, including the following, may be given for hiring \nthe consultant:  – \n(i) Terms of reference/specific tasks to be accomplished by the consultant.  \n(ii) Details of the outputs required of the consultant.  \n(iii) Anticipated benefits from the proposed assignment.  \n(iv) Professional expertise and experience required for the task to be \nundertaken.  \n(v) Approximate time required for completion of the job.  \n(vi) Cost estimates.  \n The above information shall be placed for concept clearance before:  \n(a) A committee headed by the Secr etary of the Ministry/ Division \nconcerned and including representative of Finance Division, \nEstablishment Division and the Planning & Development Division \nfor non -development budget -funded consultancy; or  \n(b) The appropriate approval forum for development budget related \nconsultancies.  \n Procedure for Hiring Consultants:  \n 4. After concept clearance has been received, the following procedure will be \npursued by the client Ministry/Division/Departmen t/ Organization:  \n(i) Consultancy should be widely advertised indicating the requirements \nmentioned at para -3 above.  \n(ii) Advertisement of consultancy will indicate the range of compensation \npackage, including various facilities, depending on the nature of work \ninvolved. The applicants will be short -listed and prioritized by an in -house \nCommittee of the client organization.  \n(iii) For general/non -development budget funded consultancies, a Selection Board, \nheaded by the Secretary of the Ministry/Division concerned and includ ing a \nrepresentative each of Establishment Division and Finance Division, will \nrecommend a panel of at least three candidates in order of merit for \nCHAPTER -04                       ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      Page - 407 \n \n consideration of the appointing authority. The Selection Board should also \nrecommend the compensation packag e for the consultants placed on the panel.  \n(iv) For development budget/project related consultancies a competent \nSelection Board of the client organization, including a representative of the \nPlanning & Development Division, shall recommend a panel of at least \nthree names to the appropriate approval forum.  \n(v) Financial sanction for the appointment of a consultant on the terms and \nconditions recommended by the Selection Board should be obtained from the \ncompetent authority.  \n Final Approval:  \n 5. Final approval will b e accorded as follows:  \n(i) Development project -related consultancies will be approved by the \ncompetent approval forum and additional conditionalities of donors will \nbe observed in grant funded consultancies.  \n(ii) General/non -development budget funded consultancies will be approved \nby the Chief Executive, on proposals routed through the Establishment \nDivision.  \n Contracting Procedure:  \n 6. While making an offer of appointment, the following will be provided in \nthe contract/agreement: – \n(i) Statement of objectives of the ass ignment.  \n(ii) Responsibilities of the consultant stating particulars of the outputs \nrequired of him.  \n(iii) Responsibilities of the client indicating types of inputs to be provided to \nthe consultant.  \n(iv) Duration of the contract indicating completion dates/ termination of  \ncontract.  \n(v) Financial provisions reflecting manner of payment of remuneration etc. \n(vi) General provisions regarding matters like earlier termination of contract.  \n(vii) Mode of periodic performance appraisal of the consultant.  \n Others:  \n 7. Following further guidelines  will also be kept in view while appointing \nconsultants: – \n(i) No person retired from a government organization will be hired as a \nconsultant only to re -employ him/her.  \n(ii) Consultants should not be appointed to perform routine functions of an \norganization.  \nPage - 408                     ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                       CHAPTER -04 \n \n (iii) Special  attention should be given by the Divisions/ Organizations to train \nand develop their own personnel to take up higher responsibilities.  \n(iv) An objective evaluation and assessment of a consultant‘s performance \nshould invariably be undertaken on a periodic basis  in a manner especially \ndesigned for the job.  \n  8. In addition to the above, following further guidelines will also be strictly \ncomplied with: – \n(i) Engagement of retired officers as Consultants/Advisers etc. shall require \nprior permission of the government, in variably i.e.  \n(ii) Establishment Division  in case of retired civilian officers;  \n(iii) Defence Division  in case of retired defence officers; and  \n(iv) Law, Justice and Human Rights Division/Supreme Court/ High Courts  in \ncase of retired judiciary officers.  \n(v) The Prime Minister‘s Inspection Commission shall conduct \nregular/periodical checks in order to monitor compliance of the guidelines;  \n(vi) Any deviation/departure of the prescribed guidelines shall be dealt with \nseriously and the defaulting officer(s) shall be proceeded a gainst, under \nE&D laws/rules.  \n(vii) A uniform proforma be devised containing all essential particulars/details \nregarding appointment of a Consultant etc. for evaluation/rational decision \nmaking by the Selection Committee/ Board concerned and approving \nauthority.  \n 9. Ministries/Divisions are requested to kindly comply with the above \nguidelines and also accordingly inform their related departments/ organizations for \ncompliance.  \n 10.

It is clarified that upgradation \nof a post implies the abolition of the existing post and creation of a new po st in the higher \ngrade. Upgradation of a post does not mean automatic upgradation of its incumbent. \nAppointment to the upgraded post will have to be made in the manner prescribed for that \npost. If a post is upgraded with immediate effect, the incumbent wou ld be left without any \npost (in his grade) until he is approved for appointment to higher grade.  \n 2. In view of the position explained above, all Ministries/Divisions are \nrequested that while sanctioning upgradation of the existing posts, it should be clea rly \nprovided in the sanction letter that upgradation of  the post would take effect from the date the \npost is filled by a person in the higher grade. This would ensure that until the existing \nincumbent is formally appointed to higher grade, the post and the  incumbent would continue \nin lower grade.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Division ‘s O.M.No.8/10/83 -R.I, dated 6 -3-1983].  \n 12.2 Upgradation of Posts  \n In continuation of Establishment Division‘s O.M. No. 8/130/91 -R.I, dated 3rd \nDecember, 1991, it is stated that the President under sub -para ‗F‘ of para 3 of the \nPresidential directive No. 57/1/CMLA, dated 2nd August 1979 had, inter -alia, frozen \nupgradation of posts till further orders. Prior to this, the upgradation of posts used to be \nmade with the approval of the Finance Division and Establishment Division. However, \nafter the directive, all the cases of upgradation of posts are submitted to the Prime \nMinister for approval, in relaxation of the above Presidential directive with th e \nconcurrence of Finance Division and Establishment Division.  \n 2. It has come to the notice of the government that Ministries/ Divisions/  \nDepartments etc. are upgrading the posts without the approval of the competent authority \ni.e. the Prime Minister and concurrence of the Finance Division (Regulations Wing) and \nEstablishment Division. Similarly, the appointments against the upgraded posts are being \nmade by the Ministries/Divisions/Departments etc. without going through the prescribed \nselection process or approval of the competent authority. It may be pointed out that the \nupgradation of posts does not mean automatic upgradation of the incumbents. The \nappointment against the upgraded post will have to be made in the manner prescribed in \nthe recruitment rules  for that post and with the approval of the competent authority. \nTherefore, upgradations of posts made by the Ministries/ Divisions/Departments etc. and \nappointment of their incumbents against such posts without going through the prescribed \nselection proce ss or approval of the competent authority are irregular.  \n 3. In view of the above, Ministries/Divisions are requested not to make any \nupgradation without the concurrence of Finance Division (Regulations Wing) and \nEstablishment Division and the approval of  the Prime Minister. The upgradation of posts, \nmade by the Ministries/ Divisions without this process, may be submitted for \nregularization etc. in the prescribed procedure and for approval of the competent \nPage - 412                     ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                       CHAPTER -04 \n \n authority.  The above position may also be brought to the notice of all Departments/  \nAutonomous/Semi -Autonomous Bodies/Corporations etc. under the administrative \ncontrol of the Ministries/Divisions.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Div ision ‘s O.M No. 8/130/91 -R.I, dated 12th May, 1992]  \n 12.3 Policy for Upgradation/Re -designation of Posts  \n On a summary submitted recently to the* Chief Executive, he has been pleased to \napprove the policy for upgradation/re -designation of posts as indicated in the proceeding \nparagraphs.  \n 2.  Henceforth, the upgradation of posts shall be considered in the following \ncases only:  \n(a) When  it is considered necessary to up -grade certain posts in order to \nrationalize the administrative structure of a Ministry/ Division or a \nDepartment to make it more effective or to bring about uniformity of pay \nscales of similar posts in different organizati ons. \n(b) Where the duties and responsibilities attached to a post have considerably \nincreased.  \n(c) Where pay scale of a post is considered grossly incommensurate with the \nqualifications and experience prescribed for appointment to that post.  \n(d) Up-gradation of a post  on personal basis may not be allowed except if any \nofficer, already holding on regular basis a higher grade post, is posted against \na post, carrying lower grade, due to exigencies of service.  \n 3.  Subject to the observance of the parameters referred to in  sub-paras (a) – (d) \nabove, the future proposals for the up -gradation/re -designation of posts shall be processed as \nunder: - \n(i) The cases for up -gradation/re -designation of the posts in BPS 1 to 19 will be \ndecided by the Finance Division in consultation with t he Establishment \nDivision. However, the decision about the proposed up -gradation/re -\ndesignation of posts in BPS 1 to 19 will be taken at the level of Secretary, \nFinance Division and the Secretary Establishment Division.  \n(ii) Cases of up -gradation/re -designation  of posts in BPS 20 and above will be \nsubmitted to the *Chief Executive for approval but after seeking the \nconcurrence of Finance Division and the Establishment Division.  \n 4. ** [When the competent authority approves the up -gradation of a post in the \nsituations mentioned in sub -paras (a), (b) and (c) of para 2, appoint ment  to the up -graded \npost should be made in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Servants (Appointment, \nPromotion and Transfer) Rules, 1973, and the specific rules which regulate appointment to the \npost.]  \n                                                           \n* Now Prime Minister.  \n** Subs. and deleted vide Estt.

GOVERNMENT POLICY IN REGARD TO AUTONOMOUS BODIES  \n 16.1 Government Policy in Regard to Autonomous  \nBodies Established through Resolutions  \n A number of autonomous bodies were established by the Federal Government \nfrom time to time through Resolutions under which some measure of functional \nautonomy was allowed to the Board of Governors/ Board of Directors for the purpose of \neffective discharge of their allocated responsibilities. The legal status of such organizations \ncame up for consideration before the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.154 of 1988, and it \nwas held by the Court that organizations established through Resolutions were not bodies \ncorporate but government departments, and their employees were held to be civil servants.  \n 2. In the light of the aforesaid decision of the Supreme Court, the question \nwhether the organizations established through Resolution should be made bodies \ncorporate after fulfilling the required legal formality, or be run as a department of government \nhas remained under consideration of the government for some time. The Chief Executive has \nnow been pleased to approve the following general policy guidelines: - \n(i) All Min istries/Divisions incharge of organizations through Resolution should \ndetermine in consultation with the Management Services Wing of Cabinet \nDivision whether those organizations should be run as Government \nDepartment ( i.e. Attached Department or Subordinate Office) or as \nautonomous body.  \n(ii) Whether it is considered necessary in the public interest to run an organization \nas an autonomous body for the effective discharge of its functions, the \nMinistries/Divisions concerned under  the relevant law or draft a separate \nlegislation in consultation with Law and **Cabinet Divisions for changing \nlegal status of the organizations to that of a body corporate.  \n 3.

He / She may withdraw his/her option of voluntary retirement before \nretirement matures;  \nii. It is binding on a government servant to return any amount of leave pay \nreceived by him/her, in lieu of encashment of LPR for that period ; \niii. Later on, on attaining the age of superannuation, if he/she again opts \nfor 365 days  leave encashment in lieu of 365 days LPR, such option of \nan individual may be treated as a fres h case and he/she will be allowed \nencashment of LPR in toto.  \n[Authority: - Finance Division‘s O.M.

No.F.1(19)R.3/83, dated 11 -7-1984].  \n Reference para 25, of the Scheme of Basic Pay Scale contained in Finance Division \nO.M. No.1(1)Imp/83, dated 18.8.1983, according to which the encashment of L.P.R., which \nwas previously admissible to civil servants only if L.P.R. was refused in p ublic interest, \nwould now be admissible to the employees concerned at their own option. In this connection, \nvarious points have been raised for clarification. It has, therefore, been decided to clarify the \npoints of doubt as in the following paragraphs.  \n 2.  Under the earlier orders, the concession of encashment of L.P.R. on \nretirement on superannuation or on completion of 30 years qualifying service was admissible \nupto the maximum of leave pay for *365 days under rule 17(i) of the Revised Leave Rules, \n1980 . The words \"leave salary\" and  *\"one year \" used in para 25 of the Scheme of Basic Pay \nScales contained in Finance Division's O.M. No.F.1(1) -Imp/83, dated 18.8.1983, shall, \ntherefore, mean \"leave pay\" and *\"three hundred and sixty five  days\" respectively, a s in para \n17 of Revised Leave Rules 1980.  \n 3.  A civil servant, who wishes to forego his L.P.R. in favour of cash \ncompensation, shall exercise his option to this effect in writing 15 months prior to the date of \nretirement, and submit it to the authority co mpetent to sanction for the payment of cash \ncompensation.  \n 4.  After having exercised the option for encashment of L.P.R., the government \nservant shall have to perform duty during the entire period upto the date of retirement and \ncannot, save as stated in para 5 below, avail himself of any kind of leave, during the last 15 \nmonths of his service if the leave, at his credit was 365 days or less, and during the last 12 \nmonths of his service if the leave at his credit was more than 365 days. Provided that in th e \nlater case, leave can be taken prior to the period of the last 12 months only to the extent that \nthe balance leave at credit does not fall below 365 days.  \n 5.  The competent authority may, where it is satisfied that the leave applied for is \nunavoidable o r is fully justified, e.g, in cases of illness, supported by medical certificate, or \nfor performance of ‗Hajj‘ etc., grant leave to an employee during the last 15 or 12 months of \nhis service, as the case may be, in accordance with para 4 above. In such a c ase, the amount \nof cash compensation shall be reduced by an amount equal to the leave pay for half of the \nperiod of leave taken. For example, if an employee, who has opted for encashment of L.P.R., \nhas taken 60 days of leave, his cash compensation equal to  30 days leave pay would be \nforfeited.  \n 6.  It is requested that the cases of encashment of L.P.R. may be regulated \naccording to the clarifications contained in this Office Memorandum.  \n 3.4 Encashment of LPR on Premature Retirement   \n The matter of allowing  of encashment of L.P.R on premature retirement, on \ncompletion of 31 years qualifying service, has been under consideration of the Finance \nDivision.

It is further clarified that such a government servant would also \nbe entitled to encash his LPR upto maximum of 365 days subject to the same terms and \nconditions as laid down in rule *18-A of the Revised Leave Rules, 1980‘ as amended \nfrom time to ti me read with Finance Division‘s O.M No. F.1  (19) R.3 /83, dated 11 -07-\n1984 and F.1 ( 73) R.4 /84, dated 10 -12-1989  respectively . \n[Authority .— Finance Division (Regulations Wing) O.M.

Through the aforesaid O .M, this Division‘s earlier O .M No. \nF.1(8 )-R.4/90, dated 2nd June, 1991 has been withdrawn being contradictory to rule 18 -A (1) \nor Revised Rules, 1980.  The cancellation of OM dated 02 -06-1991 has created the \nimpression as if the facility of encashment of LPR has been discontinued is not correct. The \nOM dated 02 -06-1991, stipulates that encashment of LPR is admissible on completion of 31 \nyears service. On the other hand, under rule 18 -A(1), encashment of LPR is admissible on \nsuperannuation or thirty years qualifying service. Therefore, with the can cellation of this \nDivision OM No. F.1(8) -R.4/90, dated 02 -06-1991, the cases regarding encashment of LPR \nmay be decided under rule 18 -A (1) of Revised Leave Rules, 1980.  \n[Authority .— Finance Division (Regulations Wing) OM No. F.1(2) R -4/2001, dated 27 -03-2002].  \n 3.7 Encashment of LPR/Amendment in the  \nRevised Leave  Rules 1980 in Respect of  \n Leave Encashment/Grant of Encashment  \nof LPR for 365 Days Instead of 180 Days  \nSub rule (2A) inserted in Rule 18 -A of the Revised Leave Rules, 1980 vide \nFinance Division  SRO 70 (KE)/2012 dated 29 -08-2012 clearly says that encashment of \nLeave Preparatory to Retirement (LPR) not exceeding three hundred and sixty five days \nshall be effective from the first day of July 2012,and shall, for the entire period of leave \nrefused or  opted for encashment, be applicable to a Civil servant retired or, as the case \nmay be, retiring on or after the first day of July,2012, provided such leave is available at \nhis credit subject to a maximum of three hundred and sixty five days.

Attention is invited \nto F. R. 67 wherein it is clearly stated that leave cannot be claimed as of right.  Thus an \napplication for leave should  not be anticipated as grant of leave.  It should therefore, be \nbrought home to the civil servants serving under the control of Ministries/Divisions that \nif they apply for grant of leave, they must wait for sanction of leave and should not leave \nthe place of their duty before the leave applied for is actually granted by the competent \nauthority. Non -compliance of these instructions might warrant action on account of \nmisconduct under the relevant rule.  \n[Authority: - Establishment Division‘s O.M.

Annual \nincrements also ar e inadmissible under FR -26. \n(ii) The period of the EOL is not counted towards pension under CSR 361.  \n(iii) The EOL can cover a period of unauthorized absence; either under an \nadministrative order vide rule 9(3) of Revised Leave Rules 1980  or on a \ncourt ‘s directions.  \n(iv) The period of EOL is not considered as period spent on duty under FR-9 \n(6). \n 2. Due to the special characteristics of EOL stated above, no rule has been \nframed for its conversion into another kind of leave retrospectively because it not only \ninvolves payme nt of salary for the previous EOL period but would also involve change in \nthe direction s/orders of the authority. Moreover, a Government Servant under rule 24 of \nRevised Leave Rules 1980, has been given the option to apply for any kind of leave. The \nleave sanctioning authority has no power to change the nature of leave. This option, once \nexercised by the government servant , is considered final. Sometimes , cases for \nretrospective conversion of EOL into another kind of leave are moved on the basis of \nCSR 232 (3) despite the fact that this rule does not specifically deal with EOL. Similarly, \nGovernment decision (3) under FR -87 cannot be used for conversion of EOL into another \nkind of leave because the said rule governs the leave salary. In the light of foregoin g, it \nhas been decided that EOL cannot be converted into any other kind of leave , \nretrospectively.  \n[Authority: - Finance Division (Regulation Wing)‘s O.M.

No.F.1(15) R.4/82, dated 11 -08-1982]  \n 10.1 Leave Reserve under the S ection Officers'  \n Scheme and its Proper Utilization  \n The posts of Section Officers, Assistants, Stenotypists, Upper Division Clerks \nand Lower Division Clerks created under the Section Officers' Scheme include posts in the \nleave reserve which is equal to t en percent of the sanctioned strength in those grades. The \nposition in regard to the utilization of the leave reserve and of filling up of the leave vacancies \nin the *grades in which leave reserve has been provided, is as follows: - \n(i) No leave vacancy in the  *grades in which leave reserve has been provided, \nshould normally be filled.  \n(ii) In case there is a deficiency in the *grades in which leave reserve has been \nprovided, or where the number of persons on leave is in excess of the \nnumber of persons actually avai lable in the leave reserve and it is difficult for \nthe Ministry concerned to discharge its responsibilities efficiently without \nadditional staff, officiating arrangements may be made as a special case, after \nconsulting the Financial Adviser in the case of non-gazetted staff and the \nMinistry of Finance in the case of Gazetted officers.  \n(iii) All officers and staff employed in the *grades in which leave reserve has \nbeen provided should be asked, towards the end of each calendar year to \nindicate the approximate date  on which and the period for which they wish \nto proceed on leave during the next year.  On the basis of the information \nso collected, a leave programme for the year should be prepared in such a \nway that, at any given time, the number of persons on leave do es not, as far \nas possible, exceed the leave reserve in the *grade concerned. The officer \nand staff available against the leave reserve would thus be available to \nattend to the work of those granted leave. If there are occasional gaps when \nthe number of of ficers/staff wishing to proceed on leave is less than the \nleave reserve, the services of the officers/staff available as leave reserve may \nbe utilized for special items of work which the Ministry may be called upon \nto undertake, the clearance of arrears in  overworked Sections or re -arranging \nand weeding the records of the Ministry.  \n                         \n BPS/Post(s).  \nPage - 494             ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                     CHAPTER -5              \n (iv) Leave reserve should be treated as an integral part of the *grades \nconcerned and the persons who are appointed against that reserve s hould \nnot be labelled as such. The work in a Ministry or Division should, \nhowever, be divided in such a way as to facilitate the proper utilization of \nleave reserve on the lines suggested above.  \n (2)  This issues with the concurrence of the Ministry of Finance.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No.3 /1/60 -SR, dated 1 -2-1961].  \n 10.2 Leave Reserve Section  \n The review of the staff position carried out by the Management Services Wing has \nrevealed that practically all Ministries/Divisions have converted Leave Reserve Section \nOfficers into regular Sections by assigning to them specific items of work which are of \nregular nature. It defeats the very objective for which Leave Reserve has been created.  \n 2.  In order to ensure the proper utilization of the Section Officers and their \nancillary staff in the Leave R eserve, it has been decided  that  following  arrangements  \nshould  be made in various Ministries/Divisions: - \n (i) Experienced Section Officers along with their ancillary staff who could \ndispose of all types of cases, should be selected to work as Leave Re serve \nOfficers, and no regular work should be assigned to them ;  \n (ii) The Leave Reserve Section Officer(s) at Rawalpindi  /Islamabad or Karachi \nshould be attached directly with the Secretary or other senior officer(s) at the \nstation; and  \n (iii) When not em ployed in leave vacancies, the Section Officers should, along \nwith their ancillary staff, attend to the difficult cases of other Sections which \nmay be assigned to them by the Secretary or the senior officer(s) with whom \nthey have been attached.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No.3/1/60 -C-III, dated 4 -10-1961].  \n 10.3 Utilization of Leave Reserve Section  \n It is obligatory on the Ministries/Divisions to observe the instructions contained in \nthe Establishment Division Office Memoranda No. 3/1/60 -SR, dated th e 1st February, 1961, \nand No. 3/1/60 -C.II, dated the 4th Oct., 1961 regarding the utilization of Leave Reserve \nSection Officers. In this connection, it may be mentioned that in their meeting held on the \n14th November, 1961, the ‗Standing Committee for Cons ideration of Ideas for Improvement \nin Administration‘ observed that the Leave Reserve Officers were primarily to be used for \nthe purpose for which they were meant and should not be absorbed in the normal \norganisation of the Ministries and that when not emp loyed against leave vacancies they \nshould be used as a striking force to deal with arrears in any section or sudden pressure of \nwork. In view of this, the Ministry of Commerce, etc. are requested to re -organize their \nSections in such a way as not to entrus t the Leave Reserve Section Officers with regular \nSections.  However, if they require any additional post of Section Officer they should take up \nthe matter in the normal way. Attention in this connection is also invited to the Establishment \nDivision's Offi ce Memorandum No. 5/34/59 -SR, dated the 13th February, 1961 (Annex)  \n CHAPTER -5             ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      Page - 495          \n \n regarding procedure for creation/abolition of posts of Section Officers.  \n[Authority. — Estt.

It has now been decided in consultation \nwith the Ministry of Finance that such sanction letters should be issued by the administrative \nMinistries concerned in the usual manner.  \n 2. It has further been decided that prior concurrence of the Estab lishment \nDivision should invariably be obtained before any additional post is created or any existing \npost is abolished in the cadre of the Section Officer.  \n10.4 Filling -up of Vacancies on Proceeding  \nof Section Officers on LPR   \n It has since been decided in consultation with the Ministry of Finance that leave \nvacancies caused due to Section Officers proceeding on leave preparatory to retirement, may \nbe filled in accordance with the rules.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No. 3/1/60 -C.III, dated 6 -4-1962] . \n 10.5 Leave and Training Reserve  \n A Leave Reserve equal to ten percent of the duty posts in the Section Officers \nGrade has been provided to each Ministry/ Division. Instructions regarding the utilization of \nthe services of Section Officers in this Reserv e are contained in the Establishment Division \nOffice Memoranda No. 3/1/60 -SR, dated   the 1st February, 1961 and   No. 3/1/60 -C.III, dated \nthe 4th, October 1961 and 5th February, 1962.  These instructions, inter alia , provide that \nLeave Reserve Section Offic ers should not be absorbed in the regular sections of the \nMinistries.  However, it has been observed that with the passage of time these instructions \nhave been lost sight of by almost all the Divisions who have converted the Leave Reserve \ninto regular Sect ions. The result is that when any Section Officer proceeds on leave, no \nLeave Reserve Section Officer becomes available to attend to his work. This has defeated the \nvery purpose for which the Leave Reserve was created, i.e., to have a pool of Officers whos e \nservices could immediately become available without any dislocation when any Section \nOfficer proceeded on leave.  \n 2.  In addition to the Leave Reserve, each Division has been provided with a \nTraining Reserve, equal to ten percent of the duty posts in the  Section Officers‘ Grade. This \nreserve is mainly intended to accommodate the Section Officers (Probationers) after the \ncompletion of their training at the Secretariat Training Institute and till their absorption \nagainst regular vacancies on the successful completion of their probationary period. The \nofficers in this Reserve are also required to attend to the work of those Section Officers who \nproceed on training ( e.g. to the S.T.I., the NIM and training courses abroad etc.). \nPage - 496             ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                     CHAPTER -5              \n Establishment Division's Office Memorandum No. 2/2/62 -CIII, dated the 30th November, \n1962 refers in this connection. It is observed that like the Leave Reserve, the Training \nReserve has also been absorbed in the regular set -up of the Divisions. Therefore, this also has \nmilitated against the very concept of having a Training Reserve with the result that \nMinistries/Divisions are usually unable to make available their officers for training when \nrequired to do so on the plea that arrangements against the resultant vacancies cannot be \nmade.  This obviously retards the process of training of Section Officers which is so \nnecessary for improving efficiency in the Secretariat.  \n 3.  In order to ensure proper utilization of the Leave and Training Reserves, all \nthe Ministries are requested to review th e position and limit the number of their regular \nSections to the number of duty posts in the Section Officers Grade sanctioned for them.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

In no case should the grant of this leave, in combination with leave other than \nextraordinary leave or leave on medical certificate, involve absence of a Government servant \nfor more than forty-eight mont hs from regular duties  nor should it be granted with such \nfrequency as to remove him from contact with his regular work or to cause cadre difficulties \nowing to his absence on leave. The study leave if taken on different occasions, shall not \nexceed forty -eight months in entire service of a Government servant.  \n 10.  A Government servant whose study leave in combined with any other kind of \nleave should be required to take his period of study leave at such a time as to retain, at its \nconclusion, a balance of ot her previously sanctioned leave sufficient to cover the period \nspent in returning to duty.  \n 11.  When a Government servant has been granted a definite period of study leave \nand finds subsequently that his course of study will fall short of the sanctioned p eriod to any \nconsiderable extent, his absence from duty should be reduced by the excess period of study \nleave unless he produces the assent of the sanctioning authority in Pakistan to his taking it as \nordinary leave.  \n 12.  Except as provided in Rule 13, al l applications for study leave should be \nsubmitted with the Audit Officer's certificate to the Head of the Department through the \nprescribed channel and the course or courses of study contemplated and any examination which \nthe candidate proposes to undergo  should be clearly specified therein. If the course of study is \nabroad the Head of the Department should also forward to the Ambassador for Pakistan a copy \nof the approved programme of study. If it is not possible for the Government servant to give \nfull de tails, as above, in his original application, or if, at leaving Pakistan he wishes to make any \nchanges in the programme which has been approved in Pakistan, he should submit particulars \nas soon as possible to the Ambassador for Pakistan. In such cases he s hould not unless prepared \nto do so at his own risk, commence the course of study, nor incur any expenses in connection \ntherewith, until he receives approval to the course through the Ambassador.  \n 13.  (1) Government servants on leave ex -Pakistan who wish t o convert part of \nthe leave into study leave or to undertake a course of study during leave, should before \ncommencing study and before incurring any expenses in connection therewith, submit a \nprogramme of their proposed course of study to the Ambassador fo r Pakistan.  The \nprogramme should be accompanied by an official syllabus of the course, if one is available, \nand by any documentary evidence that the particular course, or examination, has the \napproval of the authorities in Pakistan. In the absence of such  evidence the programme may, \nif approved by the Ambassador, be proceeded with, but no study leave allowance will be \nadmissible until the concurrence of the authority concerned in Pakistan is received.  \n                         \n Amended vide Finance Division (Regulation Wing) Notification No. F.1(2)R.4/2003 dated 5 -6-2004.  \n CHAPTER -5             ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                      Page - 499          \n \n  (2)  Government servants on leave ex -Pakistan who desi re to have it extended for \npurposes of study under these Rules, should address the Ambassador for Pakistan but in \naddition to furnishing a statement of proposed study they must support their application with \ndocumentary evidence of their having obtained th e approval of the authorities concerned in \nPakistan to their applying for an extension of leave. They must also produce documentary \nevidence of the concurrence of the authority concerned in Pakistan to the grant of study leave \nor study allowance or both.  \n 14.  No course of study will be recognized as qualifying for the grant of study \nallowance, or for study leave for any other purpose, unless it has been approved in at least \nbroad outline by the sanctioning authority in Pakistan in accordance with Rules 12 and 13 \nabove, and unless, in cases where it has not been found possible to submit full particulars to \nthe authorities in Pakistan, it has been approved in detail by the Ambassador before it is begun.  \n 15.  A study allowance will be granted for the period s pent in prosecuting a \ndefinite course of study at a recognized Institution or in any definite tour of inspection of any \nspecial class of work, as well as for the period covered by any examination at the end of the \ncourse of study. In no case will subsisten ce allowance be granted in addition to study \nallowance and ordinarily travelling expenses will not be paid, but in exceptional cases claims \nwill be considered on their merits by the Government of Pakistan or the Local Government.  \n 16.  Study allowance will  be admissible up to 14 days for any period of vacation.  \nA period, during which a Government servant interrupts his course for his own convenience, \ncannot be considered as vacation.  Study allowance may be given at the discretion of the \nGovernment of Paki stan or a local Government for any period up to fourteen days at one \ntime during which the officer is prevented by sickness duly certified by a medical \npractitioner from pursuing the sanctioned course of study.  In the case of a Government \nservant retiring  from the service without returning to duty after a period of study leave , the \nstudy allowance will be forfeited. If the Government servant is under civil leave rules the \nstudy leave will be converted into ordinary leave to the extent of the ordinary leave  standing \nto his credit at the date of retirement. Any balance of the period of study leave mentioned \nabove which cannot be so converted will be excluded in reckoning service for pension.  \n 17.  Government servants granted study leave are ordinarily require d to meet the \ncost of fees paid for courses of study.  In exceptional cases, the Government of Pakistan or \nthe Local Government will be prepared to consider proposals that such fees should be paid \nby Government.  \n 18.  On completion of a course of study a ce rtificate on the proper form (which \nmay be obtained from the Ambassador), together with certificates of examinations passed or \nof special study shall be forwarded to the authority which sanctioned the leave.  In the case \nof a definite course of study at a recognized Institution, the study allowance will be payable \nby the Ambassador or in Pakistan, as the case may be, on claims submitted by the \nGovernment servant from time to time, supported by proper certificates of attendance. When \nthe programme of study a pproved under Rule 12 does not include or does not consist entirely \nof such a course of study, the Government servant shall submit to the Ambassador or to the \nPage - 500             ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                     CHAPTER -5              \n authority in Pakistan which sanctioned his leave, as the case may be, a diary showing how \nhis tim e has been spent, and a report indicating fully the nature of the methods and \noperations which have been studied, and including suggestion as to the possibility of \napplying such methods or operations to Pakistan. The sanctioning authority in Pakistan will \ndecide whether the diary and report show that the time of the Government servant has been \nproperly employed, and will determine accordingly for what period the study allowance \nreferred to in Rule 15 may be granted.  \n 19.  Study leave will count as service f or promotion and pension, but not for \nleave. It will not affect any leave which may already be due to a Government servant; it will \ncount as extra leave on half average pay and will be taken into account in reckoning the \naggregate amount of leave on half a verage pay taken by the Government servant towards the \nmaximum period admissible under the Fundamental Rules. \n 20.  During study leave a Government servant will draw half pay. A Government \nservant may, subject to the approval of the proper authorities bei ng obtained as required by \nRule 12 or 13, undertake or commence a course of study during leave on average pay, and, \nsubject to Rules 15 and 16, draw study allowance in respect thereof, provided that study \nallowance is not drawn for an aggregate period exce eding two years during the entire service \nof a Government servant.  This rule applies to military officers in civil employment taking \nleave under the Fundamental Rules.  \n 21.  On an application for study leave abroad being sanctioned by a Local \nGovernment, it should inform the Ambassador of the particulars of the case. It will be \nnecessary for the Government servant concerned to place himself in communication with the \nAmbassador, who will arrange any details and issue any letters of introduction that may be \nrequired.  \n[Authority. - Finance Division ‘s Notification No. S.R.O. 923(I)/85, dated 8 -9-1985  \npublished in gazette of Pakistan, Extraordinary dated 1 -10-1985].  \n 12.1 Casual Leave – Grant of Maximum Leave at a Time  \n Amount of Casual Leave admissible during a calendar year and the maximum at a \ntime. It has been decided that Casual Leave upto a maximum of 20 days in a calendar year \nmay be granted to the staff employed in the offices of the Federal Government.  \n[Authority. - Home Affairs Division ‘s O.M. No.34/27/ 48-Public, dated 13 -3-1948].  \n \n 12.2 Grant of Casual Leave at a Time  \n  Under the existing orders, 20 days' Casual Leave is admissible during a calendar \nyear, and the maximum amount that can be allowed at a time is 10 days in the case of \nmembers of staff and  15 days in the case of officers.  It has now been decided that 15 days' \ncasual leave at a time may be granted to the members of staff also. This rule may be relaxed \nat the discretion of the Head of Department in special circumstances in the case of office rs as \nwell as members of staff.  \n 2.  It has also been decided that Ministries, Departments, etc., should be more \nliberal in the grant of casual leave.  Although casual leave cannot be claimed as a matter of \n                         \n Compilation of FR&SR, Vol I, Part IV, Chapter 10.

No.9/2/53 -Public, dated 12 -8-1953].  \n 12.3 Spreading of Casual Leave  \nOver Two Years   \n A question has been raised whether casual leave can be granted within the \nprescribed limit at one time in such a manner as to spread it over 2 years, i.e. some portion of \nit in one calendar year and the rest in the following year in one stretch.  It has been decided \nthat a He ad of Department may grant casual leave in one spell within the prescribed limit so \nas to debit a part of it against the account of one calendar year and part of it against the \naccount of the following calendar year, provided leave is due.  For instance, i f a person take \n15 days casual leave on the 22nd December and has to his credit 10 days casual leave in that \nyear, there will be no objection if 10 days leave is debited against that credit and the \nremaining 5 days are debited to the account of the followi ng year.  In other words, he would \nbe deemed to have taken 10 days casual leave at the end of that year and 5 days leave in the \nbeginning of the next year.  \n[Authority. - Home Affairs Division ‘s O.M. No.9/1/56 -Public, dated 9 -8-1956].  \n 12.4 Combination of Ca sual Leave with Holidays  \n Some doubts have been raised regarding the combination of casual leave with \nholidays.  After careful consideration of the matter it has been decided that:  \n (a) casual leave may be prefixed or suffixed to a closed or optional holi day, \n (b) casual leave may be sandwitched in between two closed or optional \nholidays.  \n 2.  However, if a closed or an optional holiday falls between two days of casual \nleave it should also be counted as a casual leave.  \n[Authority. - Home Affairs Division ‘s O.M. No.9/1/53 -Public, dated 24 -4-1953].  \n12.5 Procedure for Grant of Casual Leave  \nto the Secretaries to the Government  \nand Heads of Departments  \n A question has been raised as to who should grant leave to Secretaries to the \nGovernment of Pakistan.  \n 2.  According to item 48 in Appendix 13 of the Fundamental and Supplementary \nRules -Volume II, the Ministries have been delegated full powers to grant leave to a gazetted \nGovernment Servant not in foreign service.  \n 3.  In accordance with the above rule, the Secr etary as the official head of the \nDivision is empowered to grant leave to his subordinates. It is not, however, clear as to who \nis the appropriate authority for grant of leave to the Secretaries. Under the Rules of Business, \n1973, the Minister, who is the next higher authority, is  mainly concerned with policy matters \nand does not ordinarily pass executive orders himself.  Normally, such cases have to be \nPage - 502             ESTACODE (EDITION -2021)                     CHAPTER -5              \n submitted for the President's orders.  In order to avoid frequent references to the President, \nthe follow ing procedure has been laid down: - \n  (i) The Minister -in-Charge may grant casual leave upto 10 days to a Secretary to \nthe Government of Pakistan on behalf of the President and the Establishment \nDivision should be informed in such cases.  \n (ii) All cases of casual leave beyond 10 days and cases of earned leave upto a \nperiod of 1 month will be submitted through the Minister to the President for \norders under intimation to the Establishment Division.  \n  (iii) Leave applications of Secretaries for a period of mor e than 1 month would be \nendorsed by the Minister to the Establishment Division for obtaining the \nPresident's orders.  \n 4. The above instructions may please be brought to the notice of all concerned \nfor strict compliance.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

From the replies received, the Establishment Di vision has observed that no uniform \npractice is being followed in this regard. While some officers appropriate their own casual \nleave without reference to the Ministry/Division concerned, and take permission only when \nthey have to leave the station, others  simply inform the Ministry/Division after the casual \nleave has been availed of. The question of laying down a uniform policy in this regard has \nbeen examined in the Establishment Division and the following instructions are issued for \ncompliance: - \n (1) The Heads of Attached Departments/Subordinate Offices should obtain, as \nfar as possible, prior approval of the Ministry/Division concerned before \navailing themselves of the casual leave, when the purpose thereof could be \nforeseen in advance.  \n (2) In case of u nforeseen and urgent circumstances when the casual leave is \nrequired for one or two days and it is not possible to obtain prior permission, \nhe may avail of the leave and send leave application to the authority concerned \nimmediately, and may also, if possib le, inform the authority on telephone.  \n (3) In special circumstances when even the procedure mentioned at (2) above \ncannot be followed, the officers should appropriate their own casual leave \nand inform in writing, the officer concerned in the Ministry/Divi sion as early \nas possible.  \n 2.  As regards the status  of officers in the Ministries/ Divisions administratively \nconcerned to whom the Heads of Attached Departments/  Subordinate Offices should apply \nfor casual leave, the normal procedure for applying to the next higher officer should be \nfollowed. For example, if the Head of the Department/Subordinate Office enjoys the status \nof Deputy Secretary to the Federal Government or is of equivalent rank, he may apply to the \nJoint Secretary of the Ministry/Division con cerned and so on.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

Similarly, \naccording to Government Order under F.R 51 -A, the grant of return passage to Pakistan on \nconclusion of deputation abroad is conditional on the official's return to duty forthwith on the \nconclusi on of the deputation, unless the arrangement to the contrary effect had been specially \npermitted at the time the deputation closes, or is about to close, and the proposed leave is \nbegun. A question ha d been raised as to whether in view of these instruction s, the grant of \ncasual leave to a Government Servant deputed outside Pakistan on temporary official duty or \non training, either before the commencement or after the expiry of the sanctioned period of \ndeputation, which, would have the effect of extending hi s stay outside Pakistan, would be in \norder.  It is clarified that although there is no absolute bar on the grant of casual leave outside \nPakistan in such cases, it should , ordinarily be discouraged and should be allowed only in \nexceptional circumstances.  \n[Authority: - Finance Division‘s O.M.

POSTING & TRANSFER  \n 1.1 General Conditions Regarding Postings,  \n  Transfers and Deputation - F.R. 15  \n (a)  The Governor -General may transfer a Government servant from one post to \nanother; provided that, except – \n(1) on account of inefficiency or misbehaviour,  \n  or  \n(2) on his written request,  \n a Government servant shall not be transferred substantively to, or, except in a \ncase covered by rule 49, appointed to officiate in, a post carrying less pay \nthan the pay of the permanent post on which he holds a lien or would hold a \nlien had, his lien not been suspended under rule 14.  \n(b)  Nothing contained in clause (a) of this Rule or in  clause (13) of Rule 9 shall \noperate to prevent the retransfer of a Government servant to the post on \nwhich he would hold a lien, had it not been suspended in accordance with the \nprovisions of clause (a) of rule 14.  \n Government decision. – Permanent transfe rs from a higher to a lower scale in \nanticipation of the abolition of a post are not transfers within the meaning of \nF.R. 15.  \n[Authority. - Government of In dia, Finance Div .‘s letter No.F -452-R.I/27, dated 1 -2-1928].  \n 1.2 Policy Guidelines for Postings/Transfers of Officers  \n It has now been decided by the President that postings/transfers of officers of \nGrade -17 and above in all Occupational Groups/Servi ces/Ex -cadre posts, etc., will, \nhenceforth, be made according to the Rules of Business, 1973 by the respective Ministries/  \nDepartments who are responsible for their administrative control.  \n 2.  The following guidelines may, however, be observed by the Ministries/  \nDepartments regardi ng policy concerning transfers: — \n(1) Transfer between Pakista n and foreign countries should normally be made \nonly after 3 years. If an officer is required to be transferred earlier than 3 \nyears, the orders of Establishment Division are required to be obtained.  \n                                                           \n President/Prime Minister.  \n BPS. \n  Page - 516                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n (2) Officers should not be transferred as a result of their taking leave for short \nperiods for rest and recreation for which only acting arrangements should be \nmade.  \n(3) Ordinarily 3 months notice should be given to government servants who are \ntransferred from one station to another to enable them to plan the ir affairs.  \n 3.  The above instructions may be passed on to departments under the \nadministrative control of the Division/Ministry.  \n[Authority. - Establishment Secretary ‘s D.O. letter No.1/24/78, C.P., dated 30 -9-1978].  \n 1.3 Normal Tenure of Posting  \n It has been observed that government instructions with regard to normal tenure for \nan officer on the same job/post issued from time to time are not being followed with the \nresult that in some Ministries/Divisions/Departments, officers have continued to work on th e \nsame desk for unduly long periods. The position has been reviewed and the competent \nauthority has laid down the following criteria for posting/transfer of the officers working in \nMinistries/ Divisions and the Attached Departments/Subordinate Offices, Aut onomous and \nSemi -Autonomous Organizations, under their administrative control:  \n I. POSTINGS/TRANSFERS WITHIN PAKISTAN  \n (i) The normal tenure of an officer on the same post should be three years. \n Posting of an officer on the same post beyond the normal  tenure  will \n require concurrence of the competent authority, in each  case.  \n (ii) Shifting of the officer may be phased in a manner that no dislocation in \nthe official work takes place due to large scale transfers.  \n (iii) Ordinarily, three months notice should be given to the officer who is to be \ntransferred. Exception may, however, be made in case the officer is required \nto be shifted immediately in the public interest with the approval of the \ncompetent authority.  \n (iv) Orders for premature transfe rs in the Ministries/Divisions/ Departments of \n the Federal Government should be referred to the  Establishment Division; \n and in the Autonomous/Semi -Autonomous Organizations to the  \n administra tive Ministry concerned.  \n (v) These instructions will not strictly appl y to technical and professional \n officers/experts recruited for particular posts. However, posting/ transfer \n of such officers may also be rotated in their parent departments/cadres as \n far as possible in accordance with the rules of the post.  \nII. Postings/Transfers to Pakistan  Missions Abroad (Other Than Posts \nAdministered by Ministry of Foreign Affairs)  \n (i) Posts in foreign missions abroad should be filled on the basis of detailed job \ndescriptions to be prepared by the controlling Ministry;  \n (ii) The controlling Ministry should prepare a panel of suitable officers for the \npost;  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 517 \n \n  (iii) The panel of suitable officers should be considered by a Committee of the \ncontrolling Ministry including a representative of the Establishment Division;  \n  (iv) The r ecommendations of the Committee should be considered by the Special \nSelection Board; and  \n   (v) The recommendations of the Special Selection Board should be submitted to \nthe competent authority for approval.  \n 2.  Ministries/Divisions are requested to proceed further in the matter of \npostings/transfers as above and bring these instructions to the notice of all departments, \noffices, autonomous/semi -autonomous bodies and corporations under their control for strict \ncompliance.  \n[Authority. — Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No.10/10/94 -R.2, dated 22 -3-1994].  \n 1.4 Normal Tenure for an Officer on the Same Job/Post  \n It has been observed that a number of officers remain at the same desk for \nconsiderable period of time.  This arrangement is not administratively desirable as the \nofficers holding the same post for a long time tend to develop rigidity in the outlook and \nideas and do not view the problems with the same objectivity as they normally should. It is, \ntherefore, essential that officers should not be allowed to remain o n the same job for any \nlength of time. Normal tenure for an officer on the same post should be three years and \nshould not exceed five years in any case.  \n 2. The above orders apply not only to the Ministries and Divisions but also to \nall kinds of organizati ons, including the Attached Departments and Subordinate Offices as \nwell as autonomous bodies and corporations under the administrative control of the various \nFederal Ministries/Divisions.  \n 3.  As regards the technical officers/experts, if they have been re cruited for the \nsame post in which they are working, the orders referred to above will not apply.  However, \nif it is possible to rotate such officers, this may be done.  \n[Authority. - Establishment Secretary ‘s d.o. letter Nos.27/370 -F.1, dated 4 -11-1970 and 30-6-1971].  \n 1.5 Posting of Officers in Pakistan Missions Abroad  \n Refer to the decision of the Competent Authority in the Chief Executive Secretariat \non the above subject and to say that the Chief Executive of Pakistan shall be the approving \nauthority for all appointments/postings against posts in BS -17 and above, pertai ning to \nMinistry of Commerce, Ministry of   Labour, Manpower & Overseas Pakistanis, Ministry of \nInformation & Media Development and for posts at the strength of other Ministries/  \nDivisions in Pakistan Missions abroad.  \n 2. The Special Selection Board constit uted with the approval of the \nCompetent Authority in respect of officers in BS -17 and above, shall continue \nfunctioning as at present.

In the recent past a few \nMinistries/  Divisions approached this Division also supporting requests of their employees \nfor reversion to lower posts for the purpose of posting abroad.  \n 2.  The above matter has been given careful consideration keeping in view the \nprovisions of section 10 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 and F.R. 15.

ROTATION POLICY  \n 3.1 Rotation Policy of PAS/PSP Officers  \n Article 240 of the Constitution provides for the All Pakistan Service(s) (APS) \ncommon to the Federation and provinces which was/were in existence immediately \nbefore the commencing day of the 1973 Constitution. Pakistan Administrative Service \n(PAS) and Poli ce Service of Pakistan (PSP) are the only two All Pakistan Services, \nhaving sanctioned strength in BS 17 to 22 in the Federal Government, the four Provincial \nGovernments and Government of Gilgit -Baltistan (GB). Given the fact that many areas in \nthese gover nments are far flung, geographically dispersed, sharply differing from one \nanother culturally, linguistically and administratively, allocation of officers of the PAS \nand PSP to these governments requires careful and objective handling.  \n 2. For the purpose  of ensuring a transparent, objective and equitable \nframework for transfers and postings, to and from these governments, a policy framework \nknown as ―Rotation Policy of PAS/PSP Officers ‖ was introduced in the year 2000. This \nframework was amended from time  to time and needed a thorough review keeping in \nview the distortions and lacunae that were noticed while implementing this policy \nframework, since its notification. This policy has been drafted keeping in view the issues, \nidentified during implementation of the existing policy, based on the broad principles that \nFederation ensures provision of adequate number of PAS/PSP officers against the \nsanctioned posts in the Federation units and the Federal Government besides ensuring \nthat all officers are provided o pportunities to serve across the federating units before they \nattain the highest levels in governments. Rotation Policy, 2000 shall be replaced with \nRotation Policy,2020 under the Civil Servants Act,1973, so that rotation of officers \namong various governme nts becomes an unavoidable undertaking in which creation of \nexceptions is minimized. The Rotation Policy,2020 has been finalized after consultation \nwith all governments.  \nApplication and Exceptions  \n 3. The applicability of this policy will be as follows:  \n a. These policy provisions shall be applicable to PAS/PSP officers;  \n  b. There shall be no exception to the application of the policy on any  \n   grounds whatsoever, including gender or marital status except \nwhere  \n  expressly stated;  \n c. Standard exceptions  like personal hardship and spousal location, \n which are a norm in many other cadres and departments across the \n country, shall not be available to the officers of PAS and PSP, \ngiven  the primacy, priority and eminence of their service groups and \n positions they occupy; and  \n d. Wedlock Policy shall also not be applicable to PAS/PSP officers.   \nObjectives:  \n 4. The objectives of this policy are:  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 529 \n \n  a) Based on the experience of operation of existing Rotation Policy \nand the lacunae/distortions observed therein, it is important to  \nensure that  all governments, are served by the PAS/PSP officers in \nvarious grades.  \n b) The tendency of officers to remain in one government for years by \n bringing extraneous pressures is checked and curbed.  \n c) Onus to serve in all the governments on sanctioned posts is equitably \n shared by the officers of PAS/PSP.  \n d) Shortage of officers in all grades, of these services, is equally \n distributed among all the governments in Pakistan.  \nPrinciples of Policy  \n 5. Rotation Policy,  2020 shall regulate transfer/posting of PAS/PSP officers, \nfalling in the following categories:  \n a. First allocation, and service after completion of Specialized Training \n Programme (STP), in a government other than that of an officer ‘s \n province of domici le;  \n b. Mandatory service in hard areas for male officers in BS -17 to 19;  \n c. Rotation of officers serving for long continuous periods at one \n geographical location;  \n d. Rationalization of shortage of officers in each grade, among all the \n governments, by transferring least rotated officers to government(s) \n with highest shortage.  \nA. First Allocation  \n 6. First allocation of every PAS/PSP officer shall be made outside the province \nof his/her domicile on the basis of preferences based on seni ority/merit and keeping in view \nthe vacancies in each government.  \n7. A male officer shall be required to serve in the provincial \ngovernment/ICT/Gilgit Baltistan until his promotion to BS -18 or for 5 years starting from the \ndate he joins the provincial gov ernment/ICT/Gilgit Baltistan after STP as AC (UT)/ ASP \n(UT), whichever is earlier;  \n8. A female officer shall be required to serve in the provincial \ngovernment/ICT/Gilgit Baltistan until her promotion to BS -18 or for 3 years starting from \nthe date she joins  the provincial government/ICT/Gilgit Baltistan after STP as AC (UT)/ASP  \n(UT), whichever is earlier.  \n9. For PSP officers, the one -year FC posting in BS 17 will be considered as \nperiod served in the government of initial allocation irrespective of the geog raphical location \nwhere the FC posting in BS 17 is undertaken.  \n10. No transfer of an officer, on any ground to any provincial government/  \nICT/Gilgit Baltistan shall be allowed until his/her promotion or completion of 5 years in case \nof male officers and 3  years in case of female officers, whichever is earlier.  \n  Page - 530                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n 11. Policy provisions regarding posting of officers, under this section of the \npolicy, shall apply to batches who are inducted in PAS/PSP through CSS examination held \nin the year 2020 and onwards.  \nB. Mandatory Service in Hard Areas  \n 12. Every male PAS/PSP officer will have to serve a minimum of two years in \nthe hard areas notified by Establishment Division during service in BS 17 to 19.  \nC. Continuous Service of 10 Years in a Government  \n 13. No PAS/PSP officer of BS 20 and below shall be allowed to serve in a \nGovernment for more than 10 years continuously. In order to determine the length of period \nserved in any government:  \n a. The period spend on EOL/earned leave/study leave/OSD/training/ \nforeig n deputation/foreign posting shall not be considered as break \nand  will be included, for the purpose of computing the continuous \nperiod of ten years.  \n b. The time spent by an officer on a post of the Federal Government \n located within the geographical limits of the provincial/other \n governments shall be counted towards computing his service in that \n provincial/other governments shall be counted towards computing his \n service in that provincial/other government.  \n c. For the purpose of calculating a break in the continuous period served \n by officers currently posted in a government i.e. on the day of \n notification of this Policy, following special provision shall be used:  \n    for a period to be considered a valid ‗break‘ within the previous \n ten years ‘ service. an officer would have served in another \n government, and on stations outside the geographical limits of \n his/her current government, for at least one year continuously. \n Provided that period spent on EOL/OSD/earned le ave /study \n leave / training/ foreign deputation/foreign posting shall not be \n counted towards this one year.  \n d. Once an officer has been compulsorily rotated under this policy, and \n posted to a particular government, then:  \n    (i) Male officer shall not return to the government of his previous \n ten-year posting, before completing two years at stations of his \n posting situated outside of the geographical limits of \n government of his ten -year posting.  \n   (ii) Female officer shall not return to the governmen t of her \n previous ten -year posting, before completing one year at \n stations of her posting situated outside of the geographical \n limits of government of her ten -year posting.  \n   (iii) Provided that period spent on EOL/OSD/earned leave /study \n leave/ training/ deputation shall not be counted towards these \n two years and one year respectively.  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 531 \n \n  e. The current officers who have served continuously for 10 years or \n more in any of the government shall be transferred to other \n governments in three phases spanning over six months each and \n starting with the officers who have longest tenures in a government. \n Female officers will not be relocated in the first phase but transferred \n in second and third phase.  \nD. Least Rotated Tran sferred First  \n 14. To meet further shortage, the officers can be rotated even before completion \nof ten years ‘ continuous service in a government on the principle of least rotated transferred.  \n 15. Least rotated will be calculated as:  \n a. ― On the basis of the time spent posted outside the government in \nwhich  the officer has served the longest. That officer will be \ntransferred  first who has the lowest percentage of time spent posted \noutside the government in which the officer has served t he lon gest in \nrelation to  his total length of service. ‖  \n b. The period spent on any kind of leave/OSD/competitive scholarship/  \nforeign deputation/foreign posting shall not be considered as break \nand  will be included, for the purpose of c omputing the continuou s \nservice in a government.  \n c. The time spent by an officer on a post of the Federal Government \nlocated within the geographical limits of the provincial/other \ngovernments shall be counted towards computing his service in that \nprovincial/other government. T he only exception to this rule would \nbe the post of Directing Staff in National School of Public Policy, \nCSA and NPA, provided the officer was among the top three (03) in \nhis/her batch in the last of the mandatory trainings (NMC,SMC and \nMCMC as the case ma y be).  \n     Illustration:  Officer A (BS -20) has a total of 25 years service . He has served 15 years \nin Province I, while serving 8 years in Federal Government and 2 years in \nProvince II. Thus his cumulative time spent outside the government in \nwhich he has served the longest (Province I) comes out to be 10 years (or \n40% i.e. 10/2 5).  \n  Officer B (BS -20) has a total of 20 years -service. He has served 11 years \nin Federal Government, while serving 4 years in Province I and 5 years in \nProvince II. Thus, his cumulative time spent outside the government in \nwhich he has served the longes t (Federal Government) comes out to be 9 \nyears (or 45% i.e 9/20).  \n  Officer C (BS -20) has a total of 22 years service. He has served 15 years \nin Province I, while serving 3 years in Province II, 2 years in Province III \nand 2 years in Province IV. Thus, his  cumulative time spent outside the \ngovernment in which he has served the longest (Province I) comes out to \nbe 7 years (or 32% i.e. 7/22).  \n  Page - 532                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n   Officer D (BS -20) has a total of 24 years, including 2 years Study \nLeave and one year deputation abroad. He has served 15 years in \nFederal Government (including one -year deputation abroad), while \nserving 3 years in Province I, 3 years in Province II (inclu ding Study \nleave) and 3 years in ICT. Thus, his cumulative time spent outside the \ngovernment in which he has served the longest (Federal Government) \ncomes out to be 9 years (or 37.5% i.e. 9/22).  \n  Thus, the order in which these officers shall be posted to other \ngovernments will be Officer C, Officer D, Officer A and Officer B.  \n16. Government may transfer any officer from any government, and post \nhim/her to any government, at any time in his/her career keeping in view the exigencies \nof governance, before com pletion of 10 years ‘ continuous service in a government.  \n17. Shortage of officers, alongwith the numbers required for equalizing the \nshortage ratio, in all governments viz-a-viz sanctioned posts in each grade shall be \nworked out by Establishment Division in January and July of each year.  \nEnabling Provisions  \n18. Notwithstanding anything contained in this policy, Government may \ntransfer a BPS 21 or 22 officer from any government and may post him/her to any other \ngovernment keeping in view the exigencies of governance.  \n19.

For the purpose of eligibility for promotion BS -19, service of at least 5 \nyears and 3 years outside o f the province of domicile shall be compulsory for every male \nand female officer respectively. This condition, however, shall be applicable on the \nbatches who are inducted in PAS/PSP through CSS examination in the year 2020 and \nonwards.  \n23. A male officer shall not be considered eligible for promotion to BS -20 by \nCentral Selection Board if he has not served in a hard area, to be notified by \nEstablishment Division, for at least 2 years during the entire career as a PAS/PSP officer. \nThis provision shall becom e applicable after three years from the date of notification of \nthis Rotation Policy, PAS/PSP officers having completed 14 years of service in BS -17 \nand above, after notification of this Rotation Policy, shall be rotated to hard areas based \non seniority fo rthwith so as the provide adequate opportunity to all officers to serve 2 \nyears in hard areas before they are due to be considered for promotion to BS -20. \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 533 \n \n 24.

The services, cadres and occupational groups, eligible for selection against \neach foreign post, against which foreign posting is made, will be clearly \ndefined and identified by the concerned Ministry or Divisions, keeping in \nview the job description and re sponsibility of each foreign post vis-à-vis \nservices, cadres and occupational groups, the officers of which generally \n  Page - 534                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n possess the qualification, experience and skills necessary to fulfill  these \nresponsibilities efficiently;  \niii. The concerned Ministry or Division, in each case, shall ensure that selection \nprocess is completely transparent and absolutely merit -based. Such \ntransparency and merit shall be clearly visible from the processes, \nprocedures and practices that are adopted for selection;  \niv. All foreign posts that are vacant and available or are likely to become vacant \nand available within one year of the date of circulation of such vacancy, will \nbe circulated amongst the officers of the identified services, cadres and \noccupational groups, clearly specify ing eligibility criteria in terms of \neducational qualifications, experience, age and so forth;  \nv. There shall be a precondition of passing a written qualifying test, but the test \nshall be organized by the concerned Ministry through the Lahore University \nof Ma nagement Sciences, Lahore or the Institute of Business \nAdministration, Karachi;  \nvi. The minimum qualifying score in the written test will be set at 60 percent;  \nvii. Candidates qualifying the test will be called for an interview, which will be \nconducted by a committ ee to be constituted with the approval of the Prime \nMinister;  \nviii. [Sixty percent weightage will be given to the written test scores and forty \npercent weightage to the interview scores;  \nix.

Successful candidates shall be given, in order of their merit, comprising of \nsummation of scores in written test and interview, the option to choose the \nstation of their choice from amongst circulated stations;  \nxi. The tenure fixed for each foreign post shall be strictly followed and will not \nbe extendable;  \nxii. An officer of identified services, cadres and occupational groups for any \nforeign post will be eligible for two tenures of foreign posting in his entire \nservice, provided that there shall be an intervening p eriod of at least three \nyears between two such tenures;  \nxiii. No relaxation or exceptional to the above policy guidelines shall be granted \nwithout prior approval of the Prime Minister for which the concerned \nMinistry shall provide detailed justifications in a su mmary; and,  \nxiv. Failure to initiate and complete the process of selection of new officers, prior \nto completion of tenures of incumbents shall be the personal responsibility \nof the concerned Secretary.  \n 2. The Ministries/Divisions are requested to strictly fo llow this procedure in \nfuture while recommending officers for posting abroad in Pakistan Missions and against \nPakistan ‘s seats in International, Multilateral, Bilateral and Regional Organizations, Fora \nand Bodies.  \n[Authority: — Establishment Division ‘s O.M  No. 4/3/2016 -T-IV dated 16 -02-2016].  \n                                                           \n Para-1(viii,ix) amended vide Establishment Division‘s O.M No. 4/3/2016 -T-IV dated 21 -10-2020.  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 535 \n \n  IV.  IMPLEMENTATION OF TRANSFER/POSTING ORDER  \n 4.1 Implementation of Transfer Orders of Officers  \nAttention is drawn to office Memorandum No. 10/1/85 -R.2. dated 11th \nNovember,  1985 issued by the Establishment Division whereby it was conveyed that \nunder current procedures in force the Ministries/Divisions etc. on receipt of transfer \norders of an officer were to relieve the incumbent within one week with the responsibility \nof such  action lying with the head of office. In case it was not possible to relieve the \nofficer under transfer within a week, a reference was to be made to the Establishment \nDivision by the head of the Ministry/Division concerned explaining the circumstances \ndue to which it was not possible to relieve the officer and when he would be relieved.  \n2. The tendency of not honouring the Notifications issued by the \nEstablishment Division puts Establishment Division in an embarrassing position besides \ncreating administra tive difficulties/problems for the Ministries/Divisions where such \nofficers are being posted. It would be appreciated that whereas the Ministries/Divisions \nhave to look after their own interest only, the Establishment Division is required to \noversee the po sition of the postings/transfers in all Ministries/Divisions of the Federal \nSecretariat. This situation is accentuated when are faced with shortage of Section Officers \nin the Federal Secretariat.  \n3. In view of the above it is re -iterated that when orders of transfer of an \nofficer serving under a particular Ministry/Division are received he should be relieved \nwithin a week ‘s time. Furthermore, if the transfer of an officer is pending with your \nMinistry /Division the same may please be implemented immediatel y, failing which \ndisciplinary action may be taken against the officer under transfer.   \n[Authority: —Establishment Division ‘s O.M No. 6/3/92-OMG -II dated 06-12-1993] \n 4.2 Posting and Transfer of Officers  \nThe instructions issued by Establishment Division vide  O.M. No. 16/1/85 -R-2 \ndated 11th November 1985 and D.O letter No. 6/3/92 -OMG -II dated 6th December, 1993 \nand to the state that instances have come to the notice of the Government where \nofficers(s) on promotion or transfer to other Ministry(s)/ Division(s) are not relieved \npromptly by the offices where they were serving to enable them to take u p their new \nassignments. Similarly, in certain cases, the transferred officers are not taken on \ncharge/accepted in their new assignments on one pretext or the other. This tendency of \nnot honoring Notifications issued by Establishment Division, in the publi c interest, \ncreates administrative difficulties/ problems for the Ministries/Divisions where such \nofficers are being posted.  \n2. In view of above it is once again reiterated that whenever orders of \ntransfer/posting of an officer received these should be imp lemented in letter and spirit. In \ncase of non -compliance Establishment Division will be constrained to take action against \nthe officers under transfer.  \n[Authority: — Establishment Division ‘s O.M No. 1/1/2014 -OMG -II dated 24-03-2014] \n \n  Page - 536                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n 4.3 Surrender of Sectio n Officers Without Issue  \nof Notification by Establishment Division  \nThe Establishment Division have noticed a tendency among \nMinistries/Divisions that when they are not satisfied with the performance of a Section \nOfficer they surrender the officer without consulting the Establishment Division and do \nnot wait for issue of formal notification by the Establishment Division. This action \ncreates a problem for the Establishment Division because the officer report to the \nEstablishment Division and Establishment Di vision has to pay them salary for the period \ntill they are posted elsewhere, thus unnecessarily burdening the budget of the \nEstablishment Division.  \n2. The Establishment Division have  decided that Ministries/Divisions should \nnot surrender Section Officers unless and until a proper notification has been issued by \nthe Establishment Division. If a Section Officer is not desired to be retained by any \nMinistry/Division, a formal request ind icating specific reasons for surrender may be \nintimated in the first instance, and after issue of notification, the officer may be relieved \nfor joining his new posting. If , however, any Ministry surrenders an officer without \nwaiting for a proper notificat ion from the Establishment Division, Establishment Division \nwill not be obliged to provide a replacement section officer to the Ministry.  \n[Authority: —Establishment Division ‘s d.o letter No. 1/1/86 -OMG.II. dated 20 -02-1986]  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 537 \n \n V.  GRANT OF LEAVE  \n 5.1 Grant of Leave to Transferred Officers  \n It has been decided that, in future, an officer transferred to another post, either in \nthe Federal Secretariat, its Attached Departments or Subordinate Offices, or to a post \nunder a Provincial Government on reversion from the charge should not be allowed leave \nfor any period, except by the authority to whose control he is transferred.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Div. ‘s O.M. No. 6 (21)/ 60 -E.IX, dated 8 -10-1960].  \n 5.2 Grant of Leave and Notification  \nof Transferred Officers  \n Doubts have arisen as to who should sanction and notify the leave in the case of \nofficers referred to in the Establishment Division ‘s Office Memorandum No.6 \n(21)/60 -E.IX, dated the 8th October, 1960. The intention is that, after the date of issue  of \ntransfer orders, leave should be allowed and notified only by the authority under whose \ncontrol the officer transferred has to go.  \n[Authority. – Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No. 8/20/ 60 -F.I., dated 30 -11-1961].  \n 5.3 Charge Report by Officers Proceeding on Transfer  \n Officers proceeding on long leave, transfer or retirement are required to sign a \ncertificate of transfer of charge (Form TR -I) under Rule 114 of General Financial Rules, \nVol.-I. In cases where the transfer of charge involves assump tion of responsibility for \ncash, stores, etc., the instructions laid down in rule 44 of Treasury Rules, Volume -I and \nrules 115 and 150 of the General Financial Rules, Vol. -I are followed.  As regards \nmaintenance and handing/taking over of classified and acc ountable documents adequate \ninstructions exist vide paras 25 to 29 of the booklet ―Security of Classified Matter in \nGovernment Departments ‖. \n 2.  There is, however, no institutional arrangement in the Federal Secretariat \nunder which an officer, proceeding on long leave, transfer or retirement should leave \nbehind a memorandum on matters of importance concerning his charge, for the benefit of \nthe succ essor. Consequently, the successor has now himself to grope and find out major \ndevelopment about various issues relating to his office, either incidentally or as and when \nthey force his attention because of their urgency or importance. This lack of institu tional \narrangement could affect adversely proper perspective or continuity in the handling of \nproblems at different levels.  \n 3.  It has, therefore, been decided that, apart from the procedure being \nfollowed in respect of cash, stores etc. mentioned in para  1 above, the officer proceeding \non leave, transfer or retirement should also prepare a brief note (Note to successor) \ndescribing important cases, major issues and the directions in which they are developing \nand any other matter that his successor should k now.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

It has also been decided that on the appointment of officers to foreign \nmissions not only their seniority in accordance with the formula b ut also their suitability \nfor appointment at that senior level would be taken into account.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No.4/16/80 -T.IV, dated 8 -10-1981].  \n6.2 Premature Transfer of Government  Servants  \nBetween  Pakistan and Pakistan Missions Abroad  \n In 1958, the Establishment Division decided, in pursuance of the \nrecommendations of the Economy Committee that the transfer of officers between the \ntwo zones of Pakistan and between Pakistan and foreign countries should normally be \nmade after three years.   If a transfer was unavoidable before the expiry of this period, \nsanction of the Cabinet Secretariat (Establishment Division) should be obtained \ninvariably before the transfer orders were issued by the administrative Ministry.  The \nEstablishment Division reiterated these instructions from time to time.  \n 2.  This Ministry felt that transfer of officials within the two zones of the then \nPakistan stood on an altogether different footing from transfer of officials from Pakistan \nto Missions abroad and vice versa .  The exigencies of service, such as inadequacy of staff \nfor certain types of posts, the special suitability of certain officers for certain Missions, the \nalmost continuous re -organization  of Missions abroad, etc. made it well -nigh impossible to \nrigidly adhere to the principle of three years ‘ tenure abroad.  However, the Establishment \n                                                           \n BPS \n Foreign Affairs Group; now Foreign Service of Pakistan.  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 539 \n \n Division were not agreeable to exempt this Ministry from the operation of the instructions in \nquestion.  \n 3.  The Secretary (Administration) discussed the case with the Establishment \nSecretary, when the latter agreed to exempt this Ministry from the application of the said \nrestraint. It may be stated in this connection that in many cases orders of premature transfers \nare issued under the directions of the Prime Minister. In the case of Heads of Missions all \norders of appointment and recall/transfer are issued in accordance with the directives of the \nPrime Minister.  \n 4.  The Establishment Secretary may kindly see for his formal concurrence in \nthe proposed exemption of this Ministry from the requirement of obtaining prior approval of \nthe Establishment Division in cases of premature transfer of officials between the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs and the Pakistan Missions abroad.  \n[Authority. -  Ministry of Foreign Affairs U.O.

A Pakistan Taxation Service Officer shall not be released for appointment to \nthe Pakistan Audit and Accounts Service; or a Pakistan Military Lands and Cantonments \nService Officer to the Pakistan Postal Serv ice (Class I).  \n (2)  If any person who, before his appointment to a Service of the Centre or a \npost in connection with the affairs of the Centre, had appeared at a competitive \nexamination, test or interview or applied for appointment to a Service or post, it is, on the \nresult of such examination, test or interview or pursuant to such application, selected for \nand offered appointment to a Service or post other than the one to which he belongs or \nwhich he holds, his release for such appointment, it desired by  him, shall not be withheld \nor refused.  \n (3)  Notwithstanding anything contained in sub -rules (1) and (2), release \nbefore the expiry of the period of contract of a Government servant employed on contract \nfor a specified period may be withheld or refused if  such release would not be consistent \nwith the interests of the public service.  \n 6.

The FPSC have reported that despite the instructions issued on 5th August, \n1980, the objective has not been  achieved. Several candidates, who appeared before the \nCommission on the basis of their ―duplicate/advance copy ‖, have told the Commission \nthat their original applications fell a prey to the clerical redtapism in their respective \noffices, and their applica tions could not be forwarded to the Commission. The \nCommission have also complained that in several cases, the Provincial Governments as \nwell as the Federal Ministries/Divisions/ Departments informed the Commission about \nthe withholding of applications, af ter the closing date and in certain cases at a stage when \nthe employee/ candidate had even been interviewed. It will be appreciated that with such \nstate of affairs, not only the efforts of the Commission are wasted, but the talented/ \nsuitable candidates ar e also prevented from selection/ nomination.  \n 3. Under these circumstances, it has been decided that: - \n (i) If the Provincial Governments and the Federal Ministries do not inform \nthe Commission of their refusal, within one month of the ―closing date ‖, it \nwill be presumed by the Commission that permission has been granted to \nthe employee/ candidate who has applied in advance; and  \n(ii) In view of (i) above, if a departmental candidate/employee is selected/  \nnominated by the Commission, the parent Government/Ministry/  \nDepartment/Corporation etc. of that candidate shall be bound to relieve \nhim, to enable him to join the post for which he has been nominated.  \n  [Authority: – Estt. Div. ‘s Letter No.8/54/79 -F.1-D.(5), dated 16 -8-1981].  \n7.3 Recruitment of Candidates on a Pay Higher  \nThan the Minimum Scale of the Post  \n It has been decided in consultation with the Ministry of Finance that the \nfollowing procedure shall be adopted in connection with recruitment through the Federal \nPublic Service Commission when it is proposed to appoint a candidate on an initial pay \nhigher than the minimum of the post and the requisition sent to the Commission admits of \nsuch higher initial pay being given in suitable cases:  \n(i) Ordinarily, posts will be advertised on prescribed scales and there need be \nno provision in the advertisement for a higher initial pay being given. In \n  Page - 544                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n all such cases, the appointments must be made on the minimum of the \nscales. No representation for a salary higher than the minimum of the scale  \nwill be entertained from any person who enters government service in \nresponse to such advertisement without prior consultation with the Federal \nPublic Service Commission and the Ministry of Finance.  \n(ii) In special cases, however, where due to dearth of sui table candidates or \nwhere previous attempts to attract candidates on the minimum of the scale \nhad failed, it may be felt necessary to provide for a higher starting pay.  In \nsuch cases, whenever the requisitions for recruitment are sent to the \nFederal Publi c Service Commission, the prior concurrence of the Ministry \nof Finance must be obtained, if it is intended in deserving cases to provide \na higher initial pay than the minimum of the advertised scale.  The limit in \nthe scale up to which the Federal Public S ervice Commission may be \nauthorised to recommend the starting salary will be laid down by the \nFinance Ministry in each such case.  \n(iii) Before a recommendation as to the higher initial pay made by the \nCommission is accepted by the Ministry concerned, the c oncurrence of the \nMinistry of Finance must be obtained.  \n(iv) Normally, no candidate should be given a salary higher than that \nrecommended by the Commission.  If, however, in an exceptional case it \nis considered desirable to give a higher salary to a candid ate than that \nsuggested by the Commission, it will be necessary to obtain the \nconcurrence of the Commission before seeking the approval of the \nMinistry of Finance.  \n(v) Any subsequent recommendation made by the Commission must, before it \nis accepted, have t he prior concurrence of the Ministry of Finance.  \n 2. The procedure outlined above, will apply to posts to which recruitment is \nmade on contract.  Each such case will however, be considered on its merits as regards \nthe scale of pay and the maximum of the higher start.  \n [Authority: – Estt. Div. ‘s O.M.No.11/4/50 -SEI, dated 16 -5-1951].  \n 7.4 Modifications in Requisitions  \nPlaced with FPSC  \n Reference instructions contained in the Establishment Division O.M. No. \n9/3/73 -DV, dated 26th November, 1973 and O.M. No. 2/10/74 - F.IV, dated 18th  \nDecember, 1974.  \n 2. Instances continue to come to notice where after placing requisitions, for \nrecruitment with the Federal Public Service Commission, the Ministries/Divisions/ \nDepartments have made changes in those requisitions.   In some cases, the number of \nposts notified for recruitment was reduced, in other cases the qualifications notified were \nmodified.  There have also been cases where the domicile for the post was changed or the \nrequisition altogether withdrawn after the p ost had been advertised and the candidates \ninterviewed. Such modifications in requisitions placed with the Commission are not only \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 545 \n \n against the instructions issued by the Establishment Division but also place the \nCommission as well as the government in grea t embarrassment, apart from delay in \nrecruitment and wastage of public time and money. It has, therefore, been decided that, in \nfuture, if for very cogent reasons a requisition placed with the Commission has to be \namended or cancelled, the reference to the  Commission should be made under the \nsignature of the Secretary of the Ministry/Division concerned giving the reasons for the \nproposed amendment. A copy of the communication should be endorsed to the \nEstablishment Division.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

It has been  brought to the notice of Establishment Division by the Federal \nPublic Service Commission that requests for amendment/ cancellation of the requisitions \nfor recruitment on the plea of amendment in the recruitment rules are still being received \nby them after  the posts are advertised and, in some cases, even after notice for interview \nis issued.  The Commission have observed that such amendments are generally proposed \nto accommodate ad -hoc appointees who otherwise do not fulfill the requirements of the \nrelevan t recruitment rules.  \n 3. As such situations cause embarrassment to the Commission, and result in \nconsiderable waste of time and funds spent on re -advertisement, it has been decided that \nin future no request for amendment/withdrawal of requisition for recru itment will be \nentertained by the Commission on the plea of an amendment in the recruitment rules. The \namendments, if any, will have only prospective and not retrospective application.  \n 4. With a view to exercising proper check on such requests for amendme nt, \ncancellation/withdrawal of requisition etc., it has been decided that, in future, all such \nrequests should be routed through the Establishment Division by Ministries/ Divisions \netc. \n[Authority: – Estt.

In either case \nthe Commission may use its discretion to recommend and to fix the number of such \nincrements within the prescribed limit or not to recommend the premature in crements.  \n 3. As explained above, in cases where the F.P.S.C. has nominated a person \nwithout recommending premature increments, there is no justification for a Ministry/  \nDivision/ Department to ask the Commission for recommendations for such increments.  \n 4. Ministries/Divisions are requested to explain the above position to all the \nDepartments/Offices under their jurisdiction.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

FPSC has reported that, over the years, it has been noticed that the \nDepartmental Representatives are either not nominated at all or they do not attend on \nspecified dates. At times they come lat e also. Generally, officers of BPS 19 or below are \nnominated. They, very often, do not have the requisite experience and/or lack relevant \nprofessional/ technical expertise in the field of the advertised post. The Commi ssion is \nnot informed about the non -availability of a qualified officer for which last minute \nalternative arrangements are impossible to make.  The names/addresses of the \nDepartmental Representatives are seldom given, nor are their telephone (Office and \nResidential) numbers provided. Thus the Commission is prevented from reaching them to \nensure their presence.  \n 3.

The Prime Minister has taken a serious view of this \nsituation and has directed that: - \n (a) In all cases of appointment on contract, re -employment, secondment or \ndeputation, the period of appointment should be clearly specified.  \n (b) On the last date of the specified period, the officer should automatically \nstand relieved of his duties unless the  orders of the competent authority \nhave been obtained in advance extending the period.  \n 2.

What \nhappens is that either a deputationist does not want to come back to his parent department \nor the borrowing department does not al low him to revert to his parent department on \nexpiry of his term of deputation. This practice is against the interest of efficient \nadministration.  \n 2.  It has now been decided that in no case a government servant should \nremain on deputation to another dep artment or autonomous body for more than five \nyears. If a government servant has completed his maximum period of deputation, and the \ndepartment still feels the need of his services, the borrowing department/organization \nshould write to the lending departme nt to replace him by another government servant of \nthe same grade and qualification, failing which the borrowing organization would make \ntheir own arrangements. If a person is not willing to come back to his department on \nexpiry of the period of his deputa tion and tenders his resignation , that  may normally be \naccepted.  \n 3.  All Ministries, Divisions and Departments are requested to review the \ncases of deputationists and take necessary action in the light of the above instructions.  \n 4.  This supersedes all p revious instructions on the subject.  \n8.6 Deputation of Government Servants –  \nNormal Period of Deputation and   \nExtension  \n Reference Establishment Division ‘s OM No. 4/1/84 -R-I(A), dated 20-11-1986 \naddressed to all Federal Secretaries/Provincial Chief Secretaries, wherein the following \ndirective of the Prime Minister was communicated:  \n(a) In all cases of appointment on contract, re -employment, secondment or \ndeputation the period of appointment should be clearly specified.  \n(b) On the last date of the specified period the officer should automatically \nstand relieved of his duties unless the orders of the competent authority \nhave been obtained in advance for extending the period.  \n 2.  The Ministries/Divisions were accordingly directed to specify the period \nof appoi ntment in those cases where it was not specified and to ensure that no officer was \nappointed on contract, re -employment, secondment or on deputation without specifying \nthe period of appointment. It was also directed that on expiry of the specified period, the \nofficer should be relieved of his assignment forthwith unless the period has already been \nextended by the competent authority.  \n 3.  The standard terms and conditions of deputation which were drawn in \nconsultation with Finance Division and circulated vi de Establishment Division ‘s O.M \nNo. 1/13/87 -R.I, dated 03 -12-1990, provide that ―the normal period of deputation for all \n  Page - 560                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n categories of government servants will be three years.

Despite the above cited instructions, it has been noticed with concern that \nin some cases neither the period of deputatio n is specified by the Ministries/Divisions \nconcerned nor the incumbents are relieved of their duties on the expiry of specified \nperiod of deputation, and thus they continue to serve in the borrowing department without \nthe prior approval of the competent au thority resulting into administrative problems and \nlegal issues due to non -adherence to the instructions of the government.  \n 6.  The Ministries/Divisions are once again advised to strictly observe the \ndirections of the Prime Minister as referred to in para s 1 and 2 above and instructions \nissued by Establishment Division as referred to in paras 3 and 4 above.  \n 7. The above instructions may also be brought to the notice of all \ncorporations and Autonomous/Semi -Autonomous Bodies under the administrative \ncontrol  of Ministries/  Divisions.  \n[Authority: - Estt.

Div ‘s O.M No. 1/28/75/ D.II/R.3/  \nR.I, dated 5.7.1995, on the above subject. The aforesaid instructions have been reviewed \nand it has been decided with the approval of the Prime Minister that civil servants who \nare on probation on promotion to a higher post may be allowed to proceed on deputation. \nHowever, this concession will not be admissible to those civil servants, who are on \nprobation on initial appointment and have to pass/qualify a prescribed examination, test \nor course/training for the successful completion of their probation.  \n 2. Ministries/D ivisions are to bring above instructions to the notice of \nAttached Departments/Subordinate Offices under their administrative Control.  \n[Authority: - Estt. Div. ‘s OM No. 1/28/75/D.II/R.3/R.I, dated 14.02.2007]  \n 8.8 Deputation Not a Method of Appointment  \n Reference Establishment Division ‘s O.M.No.1/28/75 -D.2/R.3/R.I, dated 18th \nFebruary, 1987, wherein the normal period of deputation for all categories of government \nservants had been fixed as three years, extendable by another two years with the prior \napproval of the competent authority. Under the said instructions, Secretaries of  the \nMinistries/Divisions concerned were authorized to grant extension in deputation period \n                                                           \n Now Prime Minister.  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 561 \n \n beyond the initial period of three years in respect of government servants holding posts in \nBPS-17 to BPS -19. \n 2.  It has been observed, however, that there is a gr owing tendency to resort \nto postings through deputationists despite the fact that deputation is not a normal \nprescribed method of appointment as, under the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion \nand Transfer) Rules, 1973, three methods of appointments are required to be made either \nby promotion or by initial appointment or by transfer. The method of appointment to \nposts is also prescribed in the recruitment rules. Filling up the posts through deputation, if \nnot provided so in the recruitment rules, leads to  following adverse implications: - \n(i) In case of promotion posts, the promotions of departmental personnel are \ndelayed/stopped.  \n(ii) In case the post is required to be filled through initial appointment, quota \nof a particular province is affected.  \n 3.  In orde r to bring the deputation policy in conformity with the present \npolicy of postings and transfers circulated vide Establishment Division ‘s O.M.  \nNo.10/10/94 -R.2, dated 22nd March, 1994, and also to discourage the increasing tendency \nof postings through deput ation, it has been decided that, in future, the deputation period \nwill be limited to three years only. A maximum two years extension in the deputation \nperiod will be considered only in exceptional cases, in the public interest, and with the \nprior approval of the Establishment Division in all cases of government servants in BPS -\n17 and above. The extension cases shall be forwarded to the Establishment Division at \nleast six months before the expiry of the three -year deputation period and with proper \njustificat ion for the proposal. However, no deputation proposals will be entertained which \nwill adversely affect the method of appointment to the post as laid down in the \nrecruitment rules. Accordingly, all such proposals must invariably be accompanied by a \nformal a ssurance signed by at least the Joint Secretary (Admn) to that effect.  \n 4.  Ministries/Divisions are requested to also bring these instructions to the \nnotice of their Attached Departments, Subordinate Offices, Corporations, Autonomous \nBodies, etc, under th eir administrative control, for guidance/strict compliance. It may \nplease be noted that arrangements have been made in consultation with the Auditor \nGeneral ‘s Office whereby payment of emoluments etc. to those on deputation will be \nstopped forthwith, immed iately following the completion of the three -year deputation \nperiod, unless the Establishment Division ‘s prior approval has been obtained and \nconveyed to the concerned Audit Circle.  \n 5.  The existing instructions on this subject issued vide Establishment \nDivision ‘s O.M.No.1/28/75 -D.2/R.3/R.I, dated 18th February, 1987 stand modified to the \nabove extent.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

It has, however, been observed that, at times, the Ministries/Divisions send \ncases to this Division for extension in deputation period long after the expiry of initial \ndeputation period. This practice is decidedly against policy instructions on the subject \nand need to be avoided.  \n 3. Ministries/Divisions are, therefore, requested to comply with the standing \ninstructions, referred to above, strictly and to ensure that case s for extension in deputation \nperiod are forwarded to Establishment Division six months before the expiry of initial \nperiod of deputation with proper justification.  \n[Authority: - Estab.

The Federal Government employees sent on \ndeputation who are granted leave and paid leave salary by the borrowing \norganization shall not count the period spent on deputation for earning leave \nunder the Gov ernment of Pakistan on their return. However, the leave earned by \na civil servant, but not availed/allowed during the period of his deputation in \nPakistan will be credited to his leave account on reversion to government \ndepartment.

No. 1/13/87 - R.I, dated 12th June, 2006]  \n 8.12 Instructions to Regulate Cases of  \nTransfers/Deputation of Staff from  \nOne Office to Another  \n The following instructions are issued to regulate cases of transfers from one \noffice to another of the ministerial staff employed in the Pakistan Federal Sec retariat and \nits Attached Departments with particular reference to the position of a deputationist in his \nparent office as well as in the borrowing office.  \n 2.  Should temporary transfers to other offices be allowed (i) as a normal \ncourse, or (ii) only if considered necessary in the public interest. – Transfers should be \nallowed only in the public interest.  The term ―public interest ‖ is explained in paragraph 4 \nbelow.  \n 3.  Should a transfer be allowed (i) normally in the same grade*, or (ii) only if \nit invo lves promotion. – It does not appear necessary to lay down any hard and fast rules \nin this respect, since as stated in paragraph 2 above, transfers will be allowed only, if \nnecessary, in the public interest, and it would, therefore, be immaterial whether a transfer \nis in the same grade or whether it involves promotion.  \n 4.  What should be done to ensure that the claims to promotion of those \nalready employed in the borrowing office have been satisfied. – (a) It has been decided \nthat, in fairness to the perso ns employed in the office in which a vacancy occurs, a person \nfrom another office should be appointed only if no person eligible and suitable for \nappointment is available in the office concerned.  For this purpose, it should be placed on \nrecord by the appo inting authority, or the Departmental Promotion Committee concerned, \nas the case may be, that none of the persons eligible concerned, for appointment from \n                                                           \n The words ―with immediate effect‖ substituted with the words/figures ―w.e.f. 1.7.2005‖ vide   Estt.

The reasons for declaring the persons \nemployed in the  office concerned as unfit for appointment to the post in question should \nbe recorded by the authority concerned. When a person is appointed by transfer in the \ncircumstances stated above, his transfer should be considered to have been made in the \npublic in terest. (b) When a transfer becomes necessary in the manner referred to above, it \nshould be arranged between the offices concerned without a reference to any outside \nauthority. It may be pointed out that a transfer should be made only if it is permissible \nunder the relevant rules relating to recruitment to the post or service concerned. In this \nconnection attention is also invited to the Establishment Division Office Memorandum \nNo. 54/2/48 -Estt. (ME), dated the 21st November, 1949.  \n 5.  The position in his parent office of the person transferred temporarily to \nanother office. – When a transfer has been made in the public interest as explained in \nparagraph 4 above, the interests of the person concerned should be protected in his parent \noffice until he is confi rmed in the borrowing office. For this purpose, when a vacancy \noccurs in a higher grade *in his parent office, the person concerned should be considered \ntherefor, and if he is selected for promotion in accordance with the relevant rules, he \nshould be appoin ted formally (and not actually) to the post in the higher grade*.  \nSimilarly, if he was officiating, at the time of his transfer, in post a higher than the one in \nwhich he was employed permanently, he should be considered for confirmation in the \nhigher pos t when his turn comes.  This would enable him to occupy, on reversion to his \nparent office, the position which he would have occupied had ―next rule― should \n                                                           \n Note:  \nNext Below Rule : In initial substantive appointment of a government servant, his pay is fixed, if he holds a lien, \non a permanent post in this manner: if the appointment involves assumption of duties and responsibilities of \ngreater importance than those of the permanent post, he will draw as initial pay the stage of time scale next \nabove substantive pay in respect of the old post. When appointment to the new post does not involve such \nassumption, he will draw, as initial pay at the stage of the time scale equal to his sub stantive pay in respect of \nthe old post, or if there is no such stage, the stage next below  that pay plus personal pay equal to the difference, \ntill he earns an increment in the time scale of the old post or in the time scale of the new post, whichever is less, \nbut if the minimum in the time scale of the new post is higher than his substantive p ay, he will draw that \nminimum as initial pay. The guiding principle for the working of the next below rule , as given in FR 30(10) is \nthat an officer outside his regular line should not suffer by forfeiting acting promotion had he remained in his \nregular li ne. Thus a fortuitous acting promotion of a junior officer to an officer outside the line of promotion, \ndoes not give rise to claim under the next below rule . \n \nProcedure for regulating pay under the ‗next below rule‘: The Governor General has sanctioned th e \nadoption of the following guiding principle in regard to the working in future of the ‗next below‘ rule. The \nintention of the so -called rule was apparently that an officer out of  his regular line should not suffer by \nforfeiting acting promotion which he would otherwise have received had he remained in his regular line. From \nthat it follows that the fortuitous acting promotion of someone junior to an officer who is out of the regular line \ndoes not, in itself, give rise to a claim under the 'next below' rul e. Before such a claim is established it should be \nnecessary that all the officers senior to the officer who is out of the regular line have been given acting \npromotion, and also the officer next below him, unless in any case the acting promotion is not gi ven because of \ninefficiency, unsuitability or leave. In the event of one of these three bars being applicable to the officer \nimmediately below the officer outside his regular line, some other officer, even more junior should have \nreceived acting promotion and the officers, if any, in between should have been passed over for one of these \nreasons.  \n \n \n \n  Page - 568                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n however, be allowed to him in respect of a promotion nor should he be placed in an \nadvantageous po sition vis-a-vis his colleagues in his parent office, by virtue of his \npromotion, if any, in the borrowing office.  In other words, he should be considered, \nwhile on temporary deputation to the other office, as a member of his parent office for the \npurpose  of confirmation, promotion, seniority etc.  He should be allowed to revert to his \nparent office with the agreement of both the lending and the borrowing offices.  \n 6.  Seniority on transfer from one office to another. – (i) The instructions in \nthe foregoing  paragraphs regulate the position of a deputationist in his parent office. As \nregards his seniority in the office to which he is transferred, it should be determined in \nthe following manner: - \n(a) When it is open to the person concerned to accept or refuse an o ffer of \nappointment in another office, he should count his seniority in the new \noffice from the date of his transfer to that office.  \n(b) When a person is compulsorily transferred to another office as a result of \nconscription, or alongwith the post and his work , he should be allowed to \ncount his previous continuous service in the grade towards seniority in that \ngrade in the new office.  \n It may be pointed out that separate seniority lists should be prepared in respect \nof (i) persons appointed on a permanent or a quasi -permanent basis; and (ii) persons \nappointed on a purely temporary basis, and the person obtained by transfer from another \noffice should be assigned his appropriate place, in accordance with the above \ninstructions, in the list of the persons to which category he belongs.  \n (ii) The seniority of a person, who went on deputation from one office to another \nbefore 31st  March, 1951, should be determined in his new office, in accordance with the \nfollowing instructions: - \n(a) In order to get the benefit of continuous service in a *grade, a deputationist \nbe permanent in that *grade in his parent office, and not merely eligible \nfor being made permanent. In case, however, he is  subsequently made \npermanent in a *grade in his parent office from a retrospective date, his \n                                                                                                                                                \n(Late Govt. of India Finance Department Endst.

The \"next below rule\" was a temporary expedient designed to \nprotect government servants from monetary lo ss and in effect meant the temporary upgrading of posts. It was \noriginally intended that the expediency should not last more than six months in individual cases. Whatever may \nhave been the held advantage in the past to leave a man undisturbed in the post b y him if the exigencies of the \npublic service required it, the need for such, considerations does not exist at present. It is the considered opinion \nof this Ministry that the concessions of the 'next below rule' should not be permitted except in very excep tional \ncircumstances and that too for very short periods. It has been decided, therefore, that the cases wherein the \nbenefit of the ‗next below rule‘ has been conceded should be reviewed forthwith. The Ministry of Interior/etc. \nshould take steps either to obtain the approval of this Ministry for the continuance of that benefit or to revert the \ngovernment servant concerned to his parent office.  \n(Ministry of Finance O.M.

If, however, he is \nappointed in the borrowing Ministry/Department against a temporary post, \nhe will ta ke seniority with effect from the date he is appointed against a \nregular post, and all persons in the borrowing Ministry who are permanent \nin that *grade, or have been appointed according to the prescribed roster \non the date of the deputationists temporary  appointment, will take \nseniority over him.  \n 7.  Transfers as a result of conscription. – The interests of the person \ntransferred compulsorily to another office as a result of conscription should be adequately \nprotected in his parent office as stated in par agraph 5 above.  In addition, when his turn \nfor promotion to a higher *grade comes in his parent office, he should be appointed to the \npost actually and be allowed the financial benefit of the ―next below rule ‖. \n 8.  Transfers alongwith posts. – As regard s persons who are transferred to \nanother office alongwith their posts, the question of the protection of their interest in their \nparent office will not arise, since they will be transferred on a permanent basis and will \nthus sever their connections with th e previous office.  \n 9.  Protection of interests of temporary persons. – The above instructions \napply to persons who hold permanent posts in their parent offices.  As regards persons \nemployed on a temporary basis, there is no question of the protection of th eir interests in \ntheir previous office, since, on transfer to another office, they will automatically cease to \nbe members of their previous office.  If, however, an occasion arises in which a \ntemporary person is compulsorily transferred to another office a s a result of conscription, \nthe question regarding the protection of his interests in his original office should be \ndecided in consultation with the Establishment Division.  \n 10.

If a case arises in \nwhich a per son holding a permanent appointment in the regular cadre is appointed \ntemporarily to a post in the ―excluded cadre ‖, in view of his special or technical \nqualifications, his case should be considered as one of transfer to another office, and \nshould be dealt  with in the light of the instructions contained in the foregoing paragraphs.  \n                                                           \n* BPS/post.  \n Note w.r.t para 5  Sl.No.8.12.  \n  Page - 570                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n  11.  These instructions take effect from the date of this Office Memorandum. It \nis necessary that, before a transfer is made, the position of the person concerned, both in \nhis p arent office and the borrowing office, should be specially determined in the light of \nthese instructions and the decision communicated in writing to the person concerned as \nwell as to the office to which he is transferred.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

No. 6/39/57 -ME, dated 5 -2-1958].  \n 9.1 Grant of Deputation Allowance  \n The term ―deputation ‖ has not been defined in the Civil Servants Act, 1973  and \nthe rules made thereunder. However, in its judgement  (PLD 1981 SC 531), the Supreme \nCourt of Pakistan has enunciated the following explanation of the term deputation:  \n―According to the practice in vogue a Government servant begins to be regarded \nas a ‗deputationist ‘ when he is appointed or transferred, thro ugh the process of \nselection to a post in a department or service altogether different from the one to \nwhich he permanently belongs. He continues to be placed in this category so \nlong as he holds the new post in an officiating or a temporary capacity but \nceases to be regarded as such either on confirmation in the new post or on \nreversion to his substantive post. ‖ \n 2.  On the basis of the above cited explanation, appointment of a civil servant \nof the Federal Government, other than an officer of the *APUG, to  a post in the \nProvincial Government would fall within the definition of deputation.  \n 3.  For the purpose of entitlement of deputation allowance, however, the \nabove cited explanation of the term deputation is not relevant because deputation \nallowance sanct ioned in Establishment Division O.M. No. 1/13/87 -R.I, dated 3rd \nDecember, 1990 is admissible only on ―deputation of civil servants to foreign service in \nPakistan ‖. The term ―foreign service in Pakistan ‖ has been defined in Rule 9(7) of the \nFundamental and Supplementary Rules. According to these rules a government servant is \nconsidered to be on deputation to foreign service in Pakistan when he receives his pay \nfrom outside the general revenues of the Federation, or a Province or Railways fund. This \nmeans tha t deputation allowance is not admissible if a person is on deputation to a \ndepartment of Federal or Provincial Government even outside the normal line of his \nservice because he continues to receive his salary during such deputation from the \ngeneral revenue s of the Federation or a Province. Deputation allowance is thus \nadmissible only in cases of `deputation to foreign service in Pakistan ‘ as defined in \nFR.9(7) and it is not admissible in cases of deputation to Ministries/ Divisions, Attached \nDepartments or Subordinate Offices of Federal Government or Provincial Government or \nRailways.  \n                                                           \n* All Pakistan Services (Change in Nomenclature) Rules, 1973, notified vide SRO 1307(I)/73 dated 14 -09-\n1973, have been repealed vide SRO 89(I)/2014 dated 14 -02-2014, whereby all notifications and instructions \nissued on the su bject from time to time were mutatis mutandis amended.  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 571 \n \n  4.

No.Dy.875/98 -DS(E.I), dated \n2.4.1999  on the subject noted above. In accordance with the existing policy instructions \nissued by the Establishment Divisi on vide O.M. No.1/13/87 -R.I, dated 03.12.1990, \ndeputation allowance is strictly allowed to all government servants including Provincial \nGovernments who are deputed under the standard terms of deputation in light of Circular \nquoted above. It is also confirm ed that term ―a foreign service in Pakistan ‖, has been \ncovered in rule 9(7) of the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules.  \n 2.  It is, therefore, clarified that a government servant is considered to be on \ndeputation to foreign service  in Pakistan when he receives his pay from outside the \ngeneral revenues of the federation or a province or railway funds. Subsequently, \ndeputation allowance would not be admissible to a person on deputation to a department \nof Federal or Provincial Governme nt even outside the normal line of his service because \nhe continues to receive his salary during such deputation from the general revenue of \nfederation or a province.  \n[Authority. - Finance Division ‘s O.M. No. F.12(1) R.3/99 -386, dated 13 -5-1999].  \n9.3 Bar Against the Use of the Term  \n―Deputation Allowance ‖  \n It has been brought to notice that Ministries and Divisions frequently sanction \n―deputation allowance ‖ for government servants without specifying the reason for the \nallowance.  \n 2.  At the outset, it may be stated that the term ―deputation allowance ‖ has not \nbeen used in the F.Rs and under those rules special duty or ―deputation within Pakistan ‖ \nis not recognized vide Audit instruction below F.R. 40. Such cases are correctly described  \nas cases of temporary transfer. The use of the term ―deputation allowance ‖ to denote an \naddition to pay or an allowance granted to a government servant on his transfer from one \ndepartment to another is technically incorrect and not recognized under the FR s. The \nposition under these rules is that:  \n(1) if on transfer from one department to another a government servant is \nappointed to a post for which pay and allowances have already been fixed \nhe should, ordinarily, draw the pay and allowances attached to that po st; \n(2) if he is transferred for temporary duty against a temporary post created for \nhim, the pay of the post has to be fixed in accordance with the principles \nlaid down in F.R. 40 and the government orders below that rule;  \n(3) if it is not considered necessary to  fix the pay of the post, the officer who \nis placed on temporary duty draws his own pay but if the duty involves the \nconsideration mentioned in F.R. 9(25), a suitable special pay is sanctioned \nto him;  \n  Page - 572                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n (4) if, however, the transfer does not attract the provisio ns of F.R. 9(25), but \nthe grant of a compensatory allowance is justified e.g., where an officer \nhas to incur extra expenditure due, for instance, to the expensiveness or \nremoteness of the locality to which he is transferred a suitable \ncompensatory allowanc e is granted.  \n The classification of the additional remuneration, in either of the last two cases \nwould depend on the reasons for which it is sanctioned.  \n 3.  The position stated above may be kept in view while sanctioning additions \nto emoluments on transf er of government servants. The terminology used in the sanctions \nshould be strictly in accordance with the terms recognized under the FRs and the reasons \nfor which additions to emoluments are sanctioned should invariably be specified in the \nsanction letter . \n[Authority. - Finance Division ‘s O.M.No.F.3 (31) -R-II(I)/58, dated 15 -8-1958].  \n 10.1 Right of Reversion to Temporary Government Servants  \n When the right of reversion is given to a temporary person, his case becomes \nanalogous to that of a regular deputationist to some other office.  Para 9 of the Office \nMemorandum, dated the 31st March, 1951 states the normal position in respect of \ntemporary staff. If, however, the employing Ministry give the right of reversion to a \ntemporary employee at their disc retion, there is nothing wrong in it. The spirit behind the \ninstructions contained in the Office Memorandum, dated the 31st March, 1951  was the \nprotection of interests of deputationists to other offices while they are away.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s U.O. Note No. 6/17/58 -ME, dated 4 -8-1958].  \n10.2 Reversion of Probationers Undergoing  \nTraining at the Civil Services Academy  \nto Their Former Post  \n It has been decided that a probationer who holds lien against his former post \nwhere he was appointed otherw ise than through Competitive Examination held by the \nFederal Public Service Commission, will be allowed to revert to that former post within \n30 days of the commencement of common training programme at the Civil Services \nAcademy. Such a probationer will not  be allowed to revert in any case after the expiry of \nthat period.  \n 2.  It is requested that the above decision may appropriately be incorporated \nin the offer of appointment in future.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No.1/17/87 -T.V. dated 19 -2-1987].  \n 10.3 Reversion of Deputationists  \n Cases have come to the notice of the Establishment Division where officers \nwhose services were obtained on deputation for a specific period were not returned by the \nborrowing department when the parent department asked for  their reversion. Attention in \nthis regard is invited to the Establishment Division ‘s O.M. No. 1(28)/71 -D. II, dated the \n28th  March, 1972 (Annex I), wherein it was laid down that officers obtained on \ndeputation should be reverted to their parent departmen t on the expiry of the period of \ndeputation.  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 573 \n \n  2.  In the interest of efficient administration, it is reiterated that the above \nmentioned instructions should be followed rigidly and the deputationists reverted to their \nparent department on the expiry of th e period of deputation unless the intention is to \npermanently absorb the deputationist in the cadre or department where he is serving on \ndeputation and the recruitment rules for the post provide for such a course. In such cases, \nthe consent of the deputati onist to the suspension or termination of lien on his permanent \npost in the parent department, as well as the agreement of the parent department, should \nbe obtained. With the completion of these formalities, the deputationist will be treated as \nregular mem ber of the establishment of the borrowing department.  \n 3.  Where, however, it is not intended to permanently absorb the deputationist \nin the borrowing department, the deputationist must not be allowed to remain away from \nhis parent cadre for unduly protrac ted period; he should be reverted to the parent \ndepartment on expiry of the period of deputation as originally fixed. If the borrowing \ndepartment needs the services of another officer having the qualifications or experience \npossessed by the deputationist, a request should be made to the lending department to \ndepute some other officer in his place possessing the same qualifications or experience as \nfar as possible. The borrowing department in no case should insist on retaining a \nparticular individual beyond the original period of deputation.  \n 4.  All Ministries, Divisions and Departments are requested to examine the \ncases of deputationists with them and take necessary action in the light of the above \ninstructions. If relaxation of these orders is required in any individual case, it may be \nreferred to Establishment Division with full justification.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No. 1(28)/75 -D.II, dated 6 -3-1975 ]. \n(ANNEX I)  \n(See Sl. No. 10. 3) \n[Copy of Establishment Division O.M. No. 1(28)/71 -D. II, dated the 28th  March, 1972].  \n The question has been raised whether the instructions issued in the \nEstablishment Division O.M. No.1/23/71 -D.II, dated 29th July, 1971 (Annex II) \nregarding proforma promotion apply also to past cases where proforma pro motions had \nalready been made prior to the issue of these instructions. The Ministries and Divisions \nare advised to review all such cases. If the officer had been allowed to proceed on \ndeputation for a specific period, he should be required to revert to th e parent department \non expiry of that period. In case no period was specified, the parent department should \nexamine the propriety of recalling the officer to the parent cadre as it is not \nadministratively desirable that officers and staff should remain awa y from their parent \ncadre for unduly long period, say, more than 3 years in the case of gazetted officers and 5 \nyears in the case of non -gazetted staff. However, if in the case of a particular department \nthe number involved is large, the recall of the depu tationists should be judiciously \nstaggered so that no large scale reversions are caused in the parent office consequent on \nthe recall of the deputationists. Priority in recall should be given to those who have been \nallowed proforma promotion in the parent cadre.  Where, however, the borrowing \ndepartments are prepared to confirm such officers and staff on their own establishment \n(provided this is admissible in accordance with the recruitment rules applicable to the \n  Page - 574                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n post) and the officer or staff is also will ing to be so absorbed, reversion to parent cadre \nmay not be insisted upon.  \n(ANNEX II)  \n(See Sl. No. 10. 3) \n[Copy of Establishment Division O.M. No. 1/28/71 -D.II, dated the 29th July, 1971].  \n The Ministries and Divisions, as well as Attached Departments and Subordinate \nOffices, have, in the past, been ordering proforma promotions (also called promotions in \nabsentia) of persons serving on deputation on foreign service, or in ex -cadre posts, as a \nmatter of course on the sole ground that the deputationists had b een approved for \npromotion by the D.P.C. of the parent department and a person junior to him had been \npromoted. This has resulted in the deputationists serving away from their parent \ndepartment or cadre for unduly long periods as such persons not only enjo y better \nemoluments while on deputation but also feel secure that their interests are being fully \nprotected in their own departments.  \n 2.  The intention underlying proforma promotions is to protect the interests of \nthe government servant only in circumstan ces where the government servant is required \nto serve away from his parent cadre because of a definite requirement of public interest \nand not merely to suit his own interests. Normally, therefore, a deputationist, as soon as \nhe becomes due for promotion, s hould be required to revert to his parent department or \ncadre so that he is promoted to the next higher post for which he may have been declared \nfit.  In case an offer of promotion is made to him and he declines to revert, he may be \nallowed to remain in th e outside post on the clear understanding that he will not ask for \nproforma promotion.  Only in exceptional cases where the borrowing department or \norganization expresses its inability to spare the officer, and the head of the parent \ndepartment records, in  writing, why he considers it necessary to keep the government \nservant on deputation in the ex -cadre appointment, may proforma promotions be made.  \nEven in such cases the period for which the officer is allowed to continue to remain on \ndeputation, with the  benefit of proforma promotion, should be judiciously fixed so that \nthe officer reverts to his cadre and is appointed to the post for which he has been \napproved for promotion, as early as possible.  Such period should not normally exceed 6 \nmonths. All case s, where proforma promotions are allowed for a period exceeding 6 \nmonths, should be reported to the Establishment Division with full justification.  \n 3.  The Ministries/Divisions are also advised that in future whenever they \nsend an officer or member of the  staff on deputation to an ex -cadre post, or on foreign \nservice, they should settle in advance the period of deputation with the borrowing \noffice/organization on the expiry of which the government servant should revert to his \nparent cadre.  While selecting  persons for deputation, care should also be taken not to \ndepute officers who would soon be coming up for promotion to the next rank in their own \ncadre and may have to be re -called.  In the majority of cases, officers and staff are sent on \ndeputation on th eir application or request. They should be warned that in case they fall \ndue for promotion, they will have to revert to their parent cadre and they will not be \nallowed promotions in absentia.  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 575 \n \n  4.  The above instructions do not apply to senior appointments in \ninternational organizations such as the United Nations, the R.C.D. Secretariat, etc. to \nwhich officers are nominated by government having regard to their qualifications, \nexperience and suitability. In such cases it may be presumed that the services of the \nofficer have been placed on deputation with the foreign organization in the pu blic \ninterest, and  proforma promotion, when called for, may be made.  \n10.4 Lien of Government Servants –  \nObjective and Administrative  \nImplications  \n F.R. 14 -A(b) provides that the lien suspended under F.R. 14 (a) (2) cannot be \nterminated while the governm ent servant remains in government service except on his \nwritten request. The effect of this provision is that in a case where a government servant \nis appointed in a substantive capacity to a permanent post outside the cadre on which he \nis borne, he can ret ain his suspended lien in his parent cadre for the entire period of his \nservice under the government, vide Government decision below F.R. 14 -A.  It is possible \nthat the exercise of this right will result in certain administrative difficulties in some \ncases . \n 2.  These rules have been framed with a view to safeguarding the legitimate \nrights of government servants.  It is not contemplated that their provisions should be so \nexploited as to cause administrative inconvenience to government.  In a case, therefore , \nwhere the competent administrative authority feels that the retention of a suspended lien, \non the post by a government servant after his appointment in a substantive capacity to an \nex-cadre post for an indefinite period thereafter if the consent required  for its termination \nunder F.R. 14 -A(b) is not given, is likely to cause administrative inconvenience, it is open \nto that authority not to allow, as a purely administrative measure, the making of the \nsubstantive appointment on the ex -cadre post.  This is f ully permissible and is not \nconnected with the provisions of these rules.  The Ministries and Divisions etc., may \nkindly note this for guidance and issue suitable instructions to the administrative \nauthorities subordinate to them, emphasizing the necessity  of having this point considered \nbefore substantive appointments in ex -cadre posts of government servants holding liens \nor suspended liens in the cadres administered by them are allowed.  In this connection \nattention is invited to the Ministry of Finance e ndorsement No. 600 -RIII/52, dated the 6th \nMarch, 1952 according to which borrowing departments etc., are required to consult the \nlending departments before confirming lent officers in the posts under the former ‘s \ncontrol.  \n[Authority. - Finance Division ‘s O.M.

It has been brought to the \nnotice of the Establishment Division that sometimes when such a government servant, \nduring the course of his servi ce in the borrowing office, is confirmed, the parent office is \nnot informed.  As this practice causes administrative inconvenience to the parent office, it \nshould be avoided. As laid down in the Ministry of Finance letter No. 600 -RIII/52, dated \nthe 6th  March, 1952  permanent officers belonging to a government or department, while \non deputation to another government or department, should not be confirmed in the latter \nwithout the prior formal concurrence of the former and the consent of the officer \nconcerne d.  Once such confirmation is decided upon, after taking also into consideration \nthe point emphasized in the Establishment Division O.M. No. 8/36/59 -E.XII, dated the \n13th  March, 1961, a copy of the resultant confirmation orders should be endorsed to the \nlending government or department.  \n 2.  Should such a government servant continue to serve the borrowing \ngovernment or department till the time of his retirement from service, information to the \neffect that he is being retired should be furnished to the lend ing government or \ndepartment, unless the lien of the government servant in his parent cadre had been \nterminated at the time of his confirmation in the ex -cadre post, as visualized in the \nEstablishment Division Office Memorandum, dated the 13th March, 1961  referred to in \nthe preceding paragraph.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

It is stated that it has been \ndecided that all applications of Section Officers for deputation to ex -cadre posts under the \nGovernment or Semi -Government Organizations will be in the first in stance, scrutinised \nand examined by a Committee consisting of the Joint Secretary and Deputy Secretary of \nthe Establishment Division and a representative of, at least Deputy Secretary ‘s level of \nthe Ministry/Division under whose administrative control the ex-cadre posts in question \nbelong.  \n 2.  All Ministries/Divisions are accordingly requested to forward all \napplications received from Section Officers for appointment to any ex -cadre posts to the \nEstablishment Division at least one month before the last dat e prescribed for the receipt \nof such applications by the authority concerned. While forwarding any application to the \nEstablishment Division, the Ministry/ Division concerned should certify that the \ncandidate possesses the requisite qualifications and expe rience prescribed for the post and \nthat they will have no objection to release him if he is selected for the appointment.  \n 3.  In cases where the Section Officers are to be considered alongwith officers \nbelonging to other services the recruiting agency sho uld invariably forward a copy of the \nnotification to the Establishment Division for reference.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No.3/7/68 -C.III(B), dated 23 -10-1971].  \n(ANNEX)  \n [Copy of Establishment Division ‘s O.M. No. 3/7/68 -C-III, dated the  \n7th February, 1970].  \n It was decided by the government in early 1968, vide point No. 6 in the \nEstablishment Division Office Memorandum No.1/ 11/66 -C. III, dated the 14th February, \n1968, that deputation of CSS officers to autonomous bodies, attached/subordinate \noffices should be encouraged to give them field experience.  Pursuant to that decision, \nMinistries/Divisions have been deputing officers to other organizations but apparently in \na haphazard manner.  The following guidelines are, theref ore, laid down for observance \nby all concerned: - \n(a) While framing recruitment rules for the posts in government and \nautonomous organizations for which the services of Section Officers can \nbe gainfully utilized, the question of making them eligible for such \nappointments may be considered by the administrativ e Ministries/ \n                                                           \n Central Secretariat Service (CSS), now Office Management Group (OMG),  \n  Page - 578                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n Divisions concerned in consultation with the Regulations Wing of the \nEstablishment Division and the Central Public Service Commission, \nwhere necessary.  \n(b) Where recruitment rules have already been framed, the question of \nrevising them with a vi ew to making a provision as proposed at (a) above, \nmay be considered by the Ministries/Divisions concerned.  \n(c) Where Section Officers are to be considered alongwith officers belonging \nto other services, then applications may be invited by the recruiting \nagenc y. Such applications from Section Officers will invariably be routed \nthrough the Establishment Division vide their O.M. No. 1/8/62 -C. III, \ndated the 14th May, 1966.  \n(d) For the posts against which only Section Officers are to be considered for \nappointment, the  Ministries/Divisions concerned may place their \nrequirements with the Establishment Division indicating: - \n(i) Educational qualifications and experience prescribed for the post.  \n(ii) Pay Scale etc. prescribed for it.  \n(iii) Nature of the duties attached to i t. \n(iv) Method of selection.  \n(v) Any other special points required to be kept in view while making \nselection.  \n(e) No Section Officer will be allowed to stay away on deputation for more \nthan five years.  \n 11.3 Gazetted and Non -Gazetted  \nTechnical Services  \n A question has been raised whether the instructions contained in the \nEstablishment Division O.M. No. 6/15/48 -ME, dated the 30th January, 1953 are \napplicable to Gazetted and non -Gazetted technical services also. The matter has been \nconsidered in the Establi shment Division, and it has been decided that there should be no \nobjection to the cases of officials of the gazetted and non -gazetted technical services \nbeing decided in accordance with these instructions provided that the procedure laid \ndown in Para 11 of  the Establishment Division O.M. No. 6/15/48 -ME, dated the 31st  \nMarch, 1951 is observed in each case.  \n 2.  These instructions will take effect from 1st January, 1961.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No. 11/6/60 -E, XI, dated 18 -1-1961].  \n 12.1 Deputationists from Provincial Governments  \n The question has been raised whether, with the substitution of efficiency \nhonorarium for advance increments, it is still necessary for the Ministries/Divisions to \nobtain the consent of the lending Provincial Gov ernments before recommending \n                                                           \n Federal.  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 579 \n \n deputationists for  the grant of efficiency honorarium. After a careful consideration of the \nfinancial aspect of the matter, it has been decided that it will not be necessary for the \nMinistries/Divisions to obtain the consent of  the lending Provincial Governments before \nrecommending deputationists for the grant of efficiency honorarium provided the \nrecommendations are not based on the recommendees ‘ good performance under the \nProvincial Governments.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No. 5/l/63 -CV/LR.II, dated 13 -3-1965].  \n 12.2 Change in Terms and Conditions  \nof Deputationists  \n A case has recently come to the notice of the Establishment Division in which a \nBPS 5 employee of a Provincial Government on deputation to the Federal Government \nwas promoted to a BPS -16 post and subsequently to a BPS 17 post while on deputation, \nwithout consultation with the Provincial Government concerned. This has created an \nawkward situation for the Provincial Government in the matter of fixation of pay, grant \nof pension, etc. to the employee concerned on repatriation from deputation.  \n 2.  It may be recalled that a government servant on deputation continues to be \nunder the rule -making control of the lending government and is governed by the rules of \nthe lending government in matters of pay, leave, pension, etc. The lending government \naccordingly have a right to determine, in consultation with the borrowing government, \nthe terms of his employment under the latter and these terms should not be varied by the \nborrowing government without consulting the lending government.  \n 3.  In view of the position explained above, it is brought to the notice of all \nthe Ministries/Divisions etc. that no increase in pay or improvement in other service \nprospects should be a llowed to any employee on deputation without consulting the \nlending government or department and without the approval of the Establishment \nDivision.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s O.M.No.1/4/86 -R.I. dated 3 -4-1986].  \n12.3 Ruling Regarding Employees from Provinces/  \nAuthority on Deputation to Federation  \n Under clause (2) of section 1 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, that Act applies \nonly to civil servants.  Under sub -clause (i) clause (b) of section 2 of that Act persons \nwho are on deputation to the Federat ion from any Province or other authority have been \nexcluded from the definition of ―civil servant ‖. Therefore the Act or the Rules made \nthereunder are not applicable to such persons.  Any rules having the force of law applying \nto such persons and existing before the coming into force of the permanent Constitution \nare to be treated as ―existing laws ‖, as defined in clause (7) of Article 268 of the \nConstitution and will continue to be in force by virtue of clause (1) of that Article. Under \nArticle 241 of the Constitution also until the Parliament makes a law under Article 240 of \nthe Constitution governing such persons, all rules and orders in force immediately before \nthe commencing day are to continue in force in so far as they are not inconsistent with the \nprovisions of the Constitution.  \n[Authority. - Law Division ‘s U.O. Note No. 763/75 -Law, dated 13 -5-1975].  \n  Page - 580                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n 12.4 Convention Between the Federal Government and  \nthe Provincial Governments ‗Inter -Se‘ Regarding  \nTerms and Conditions of  Deputationists  \n As a government servant on deputation retains a lien on the permanent post in \nhis parent office, he is ordinarily governed by the rules of the lending government in \nmatters of pay, leave, pension, etc., and continues to be under the rule -making control of \nthe l ending government which has a right to recall him.  The lending government \naccordingly has a right to determine in consultation with the borrowing government, the \nterms of his employment under the latter, and these terms should not be varied by the \nborrowi ng government without consulting the lending government.  \n 2. A convention has been established between the Federal Government and \nthe Provincial Governments on the one hand, and the Provincial Governments inter -se, on \nthe other to the effect that no increa se in pay or improvements in other service prospects \nshould be offered to any such officer without consulting the lending government or \ndepartment.  \n[Authority. - Ministry of Finance letter No.F.10(23) -E.G.II/48, dated 9 -12-1948 and 10 -6-1949].  \n12.5 Appoin tment of Provincial Government Employees Against  \nBPS 17 an d Above Posts Under the Federal Government  \n A question has arisen whether appointment to posts in BPS 17 and above under \nthe Federal Government by appointment through deputation of officers of Provincial \nGovernments are required to be approved by the competent authority in the Federal \nGovernment and if so under which legal -provision.  \n 2.  According to section 5 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 appointment to \ncivil posts in connection with the aff airs of the Federation are made by the President or \nby an officer authorised by him in this behalf.  Under Rule 6 of the Civil Servants \n(Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rules, 1973 made under the above mentioned \nAct, 1973 the appointing authority for the posts in BPS 17 and above is the Prime \nMinister.  Therefore, according to section 5 of the Act read with Rule 6, the approval of \nthe Prime Minister is necessary for appointment to posts under the Federal Government, \nbut a doubt has arisen in the case o f appointment of officers belonging to Provincial \nGovernments to posts under the Federal Government.  The Civil Servants Act, 1973 is \napplicable to civil servants vide sub -section (2) of Section 1 of the Act.  According to \ndefinition of ―civil servant ‖ given in section 2 of the Act, a person who is on deputation \nto the Federation from any Province is  not  a  ―civil  servant ‖. The Civil Servants Act, \n1973 does not, therefore, apply to cases of officers of Provincial Governments who are \nappointed by deputati on to posts under the Federal Government.  If this view is correct, \nthe next question which arises is whether Article 241 of the Constitution would be \nattracted in such cases.  Our view is that since no act has been made by the Legislature in \nrespect of th e officers belonging to Provincial Governments who may be appointed by \ndeputation to posts under the Federal Government, the rules and orders which were \nenforced immediately before the coming into force of the Constitution, will continue to \nbe applicable t o such cases.  This will mean that approval of the competent authority as \nrequired under the Rules of Business, 1973  which  were  applicable before coming into \nforce of the Constitution should be obtained in such cases. Under these rules, the \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 581 \n \n approval of the President was necessary to first appointment to Class I posts under the \nFederal Government.  The President, in the present context means the Prime Minister.  \nThe approval of the Prime Minister, or of the persons authorized  by him in this behalf, \nshould  therefore, be obtained before making appointments of officers of the Provincial \nGovernments to posts connected with the affairs of the Federation.  In other words, if the \nCivil Servants Act, 1973 is not applicable to deputationists from the Provincial \nGovernments, we are not left in void.  The law provides for the continuance in force of \nall previous rules and orders where the Civil Servants Act, 1973 is not applicable.  \n 3.  The Law Division is requested for advice on the views of the \nEstablishment Divisio n. \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s U.0.Note No.4/1/74 -D.III, dated 8 -5-1975]  \n12.6 Posting on Deputation  \n It has been observed by the competent authority that Ministries/ Divisions/  \nDepartments/Organizations usually posts officer of BS -17 to BS -19 from Provincial \nGovernment to Federal Government and from Federal Government to Provincial \nGovernment on deputation basis under delegation of powers.  \n 2.  Keeping in view the competent auth ority has decided that in future, all the \nDivisions/Organizations/Departments and the Provincial Governments have to process \nthe cases of the officers from BS -17 & above to be posted on deputation basis from \nFederal Government to provincial government and from provincial government to \nFederal Government through Establishment Division.  \n    [Authority. - Estt.

It has al so come to notice that the corporations and autonomous bodies \nnegotiate directly with officers serving in other departments and Ministries and ask for \ntheir release for posting with them.  This procedure is neither regular nor proper. The \nposts generally c arry additional benefits like special pay, deputation allowances etc.  It is, \ntherefore, not fair to confine selection to one or two names which a Ministry/Division \nmay specify. Other officers with requisite qualification and experience with equal, if not \nbetter, record of service and senior to those asked for are not considered simply because \nthey do not happen to be known to senior officers in the Ministry or Corporation wanting \nsuch officers.  \n 2.  The Establishment Division will not now entertain request s for particular \nofficers. This Division will be constrained to take disciplinary action against a \ngovernment servant, if it is established that he has secured offer through influence or \npressure. It is, therefore, requested that all Ministries and Divisio ns should communicate \ntheir requirements to the Establishment Division specifying the qualifications and \nexperience etc. required for the incumbent of a post.  The selection of a suitable officer \nwill be made by the Establishment Division from amongst all those government servants \nwho answer the required qualification and experience etc.  In making the selection, the \nEstablishment Division will continue to consult the referring Ministry.  If there are any \nspecial considerations for which the services of a p articular officer are required, such \nrequests should come at the level of Secretary or Additional Secretary Incharge of \nDivision and it should be clearly explained why a particular officer is being asked for.  \n 3.  So far as corporations are concerned, the Establishment Division propose \nto prepare panels of officers of various occupational groups in different grades whose \nservices may be lent to the corporations. All future postings to corporations will be made \nout of these panels. Appointment will be mad e for a period of at least two years during \nwhich the officer will not be eligible for consideration for promotion in his parent \ndepartment.  Officers within the zone of promotion will not, as far as possible, be \nincluded in the panels with a view to obvia ting the possibility of dislocation in the work \nof the corporation in the event of their recall on promotion by the Ministry concerned.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

This resulted in \nwasteful utilization of government officers, embarrassment to the officers and difficulties \nin fixing their emoluments.  \n 2.  It has, therefore, been decided to request the Ministries/ Divi sions that \nthey should not henceforth depute any of their officers to a post which is lower in \nemoluments and responsibility than the one he is holding in his parent office.  \n[Authority. -Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No. 3/5/ 68 -A.III, dated 19 -3-1968].  \n 14.1 Benefit of Promotion in Parent Cadre while in Foreign Service  \n It appears that the position regarding promotion, in their parent cadres, of \ngovernment servants transferred to ‗foreign service ‘ [as defined in Fundamental Rule 9(7)], \nand the benefit occurri ng to them from such promotion is not clear in some quarters.  \n 2.  Cases of promotion, in their parent cadres, of government servants who are \ntransferred to foreign service and the emoluments admissible to them are regulated by the \nprovisions of Fundamenta l Rules 113 and 114 which fall in Chapter XII of Section I of the \nFundamental and Supplementary Rules, Vol. I, and not by the proviso to the `next below \nrule‘ i.e., the second proviso below F.R. 30 which falls in Chapter IV of those Rules and \napplies in ca ses of government servants serving outside their ordinary line within \ngovernment service.  \n 3.  According to F.R. 113, a government servant transferred to foreign service \nremains in the cadre in which he was included in a substantive or officiating capacity  \nimmediately before his transfer and may be given such substantive or officiating promotion \nin those cadres as the authority competent to order promotion may decide, keeping in view \nthe considerations mentioned in that rule. According to F. R. 114, read wi th orders issued \nthereunder, which have been printed in Appendix No. II to the Fundamental and \nSupplementary Rules, Vol. II, a government servant transferred to `foreign service ‘ in \nPakistan shall, unless his duties in foreign service involve a decided inc rease in work or \nresponsibility in comparison with duties of his post in government service, be allowed the \nsame remunerations as he would have received from time to time in government service but \nfor his transfer to foreign service. It follows from these orders that if a government servant \nwho is on deputation to foreign service is promoted in his parent cadre, he should, if he \ncontinues to remain in foreign service, be allowed the remuneration which he would have \nreceived in the higher post in government service to which he is promoted. The higher \nremuneration would, of course, be payable by the foreign employer.  \n[Authority. - Finance Division ‘s O.M.

It has come to the notice of the govern ment that the above provisions of \nthe rules/instructions have not been followed by some of the autonomous/ \nsemi -autonomous/  statutory bodies. In flagrant violation of rules/instructions, government \nservants on deputation to autonomous bodies etc. have been allowed the services of \nPeons/Orderlies exclusively for residence, Chowkidar and servants at the residence and \ntransport exclusively for the deputationist without the knowledge and sanction of \ncompetent authority. Government have taken serious note of such irregularities.  With a \nview to ensuring financial discipline, the Provincial Governments and the autonomous \nbodies are requested to discontinue, forthwith, such unauthorized concessions being \nenjoyed by the government servants on deputation.  \n[Authority. - Finance Division ‘s O.M.

The existing rates are contained in Appendix 11 -A, FRs and SRs Vol.  \nII. The question regarding  revision of the rates and mode of recovery etc., of leave salary \nand pension contributions has been engaging the attention of the government for some \ntime past.  It has now been decided to  prescribe a uniform rate of recovery of pension \ncontributions at 33.33% of the mean of minimum and maximum of the pay scale of the \n***grade held by the government servant concerned at the time of his proceeding on \nforeign service, plus other emoluments (reckonable for pension) which would have been \nadmissible to him had he not been deputed on foreign service.  The above prescribed rate \nof pension contribution shall apply to all Federal Government employees whether on \ndeputation to foreign service within Pakistan or abroad.  \n 2.  In future, the pension contributions in all cases shall be payable by the \nforeign employers. However, in the case of government servants presently on deputation \nto foreign service@ within Pakistan or abroad, pension contributions shall be paid by the \nforeign employers or the government servants concerned, as the case may be, according \nto the agreed terms of deputation.  \n 3.  As regards leave salary contributions, it has been decided that no leave \nsalary contributions shall be recovered from foreign employers, but leave/leave salary \nshall be sanctioned/paid during the period of foreign service by the foreign employers.  \nThe Fed eral Government employees sent on deputation to *foreign service who, under the \n                                                           \nNaib Qasid.   Recovery of Leave Salary and Pension contributions may be made as per revised rates as amended from time \nto time.   BPS.  @ Deputation  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 585 \n \n revised procedure, are granted leave and paid leave salary by the foreign employers, shall not \ncount the period spent on foreign service for earning leave under the Government of \nPakistan.  \n 4.

The \nterms and conditions of foreign service and other detailed particulars regarding pay to be \ndrawn in foreign service are required to be furnished to the Audit and Accounts Officer \nso that the rates of monthly leave salary and pension contributions are intimated to \nforeign employer, the government servant concerned and his department. Any promotion \nor reversion in the parent department is also to be reported to the Audit and Accounts  \nOfficer concerned. The contributions paid into the government account are accounted for \nby the Audit and Accounts Office and recoveries in individual cases are watched.  \n 2.  It has come to the notice of the Finance Division that in several cases the \norder s of transfer of a government servant on foreign service do not reach the Audit and \nAccounts Office concerned or, if received, the terms and conditions and other particulars \nare not given therein. Consequently, the rates of monthly contribution cannot be \nintimated by the Audit and Accounts Office to the foreign employer and the government \nservant concerned, with the result that the contributions are not deposited promptly and \nregularly.  There have been many cases in which the government servants completed \ntheir tenure of foreign service in Pakistan or abroad and returned to their parent \ndepartment without depositing the leave salary and pension contributions due to the \nreason that the Audit and Accounts Office concerned is not informed  in  time  about  \ntheir  transfer on  **foreign service. The required particulars are not furnished by the \ndepartment to the Audit and Accounts Office and consequently the latter are not in a \nposition to intimate the rates of monthly contributions resulting in their non -deposi t. In \ncase of deputations abroad, loss of foreign exchange is suffered by government if the \npension contribution is payable by the government servant and he returns to Pakistan on \ncompletion of his tenure without depositing the contribution for the reason that the \namount was not intimated to him in due time.  \n 3.  In view of the position stated above, all Ministries/Divisions are requested \nto ensure that in future all sanctions regarding the deputation on foreign service are \ninvariably addressed to the Accou nts Offices concerned. While sanctioning the transfer of \na government servant on foreign service, the monthly rates of leave salary and pension \ncontribution should be invariably indicated in the sanction. The rates so indicated by the \ndepartments concerned  may be provisionally adopted for depositing the contributions \npromptly and regularly every month till the final rates are intimated by the Audit and \n                                                           \nNote. -Under the latest orders no leave -salary contributions are recoverable from the foreign employer/  \ngovernment ser vant. \n** Deputation.  \n  Page - 586                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n Accounts Offices on receipt of which the excesses/deficiencies, if any, can be adjusted. \nThe Audit and Acc ounts Officers will check the accuracy of the rates and watch the \nrecoveries of the contributions and their proper accounting in the government accounts.  \n[Authority. - Finance Division ‘s O.M.No.F.5(5) Reg.7/77 -1082 -(2), dated 28 -2-1980].  \n15.3 Recoveries of Dues from Government  \nServants in Foreign Exchange  \n A reference is invited to the Finance Division O.M. No. F. 1(8) EF (B. \nII)/76 -2720 dated the 14th July, 1976. It is stated that the question of recoveries from \ngovernment servants due in for eign exchange has been re -examined in consultation with \nthe Ministry of Law.  The position is that the government is legally entitled to recover the \nexact amount in the currency in which the overpayment was made or the dues became \nrecoverable.  It has, the refore, been decided that if the overpayment was made or dues \nbecame recoverable in a particular currency, the recoveries should be made in that \ncurrency or in equivalents of US dollars according to the rate of exchange between that \ncurrency and the US dol lar on the date of recovery.  If, for any reason, such as posting in \nPakistan on retirement, etc. recoveries cannot be effected in foreign exchange these can \nbe effected in Pakistani rupees.  However, since permission to pay such dues in local \ncurrency is in fact permission to purchase foreign exchange for refund to government the \nrate of exchange applicable in such cases shall be the rate prevailing on the date on which \nsuch recoveries are actually effected. Finance Division ‘s O.M. dated the 14th  July, 19 76 \nquoted above may please be deemed to have been modified accordingly with immediate \neffect.  \n[Authority. - Finance Division ‘s O.M.No.F.1(8)EF (B.II)/80 -2689, dated 18 -12-1980].  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 587 \n \n VIII.   (B) TRANSFER TO FOREIGN SERVICE  \n           OUT OF PAKISTAN: DEPUTATION  \n 16.1 Receiving or Soliciting Direct Offers of Appointment  \n  from Private Firms/Organizations  \n It has been noticed that some government servants are directly receiving or \nsoliciting offers of appointment from private firms/organisations based in foreign \ncountries and are seeking government clearance for accepting such offers on deputation \nbasis. This practice, which is on the increase, is against Government Servants (Conduct) \nRules, 1964. It is obvious that in all case s of this nature, the government servants while \nstill in government service, had established contacts with the private firms/ organisations \noffering the appointment. This tendency has to be curbed because it is quite possible that \nthe firm/organization, of fering the appointment to the government servant concerned, \nmay be doing so in consideration of some favour done to the firm by the government \nofficer concerned. It has, therefore, been decided that any government servant receiving \nsuch an offer of employm ent from a private firm/organisation abroad will not, in future, \nbe allowed to go on deputation. He will have to resign from government service before he \nis allowed to accept the appointment with a private firm/organisation based in a foreign \ncountry.  \n 2.  These instructions, however, do not affect the offers of appointments or \nsubmission of applications against vacancies announced by foreign governments or \ninternational agencies. The existing procedure prescribed in such cases will continue to \nbe observed and the relevant cases should be sent for approval to the Special Selection \nBoard in the prescribed manner.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

It has, therefore, been \ndecided that in future the Ministries/Divisions should;  \n (i) circulate the vacancy announcements amongst the Ministries/ Divisions \nconcerned and Provincial Government s well in time;  \n (ii) nominate only those officers who are properly qualified for the  \njobs;  \n (iii) nominate, at least, three candidates for each job to enable S.S.B. to pick up \nthe best suited candidates; and  \n (iv) to ensure adequate circulation of job des criptions, the Ministries/ \nDivisions receiving vacancy announcements direct from international \norganizations should send the copies of their circulars to Economic Affairs \nDivision and Establishment Division indicating the Ministries/Divisions to \nwhom the p articular job is being circulated.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

Such government servants should submit \ncopies of their contract/  documents, duly authenticated, through the Pakistan Missions \nconcerned to their administrative Ministries so that their liens may be maintained and \nthey may now be re quired to return by the 30th June, 1978.  \n 2.  In this connection, attention of all concerned may be invited to \nFundamental Rule 18 which lays down that unless the President, in view of the special \ncircumstances of the case, shall otherwise determine, after  5 years continuous absence \nfrom duty, elsewhere than on foreign service in Pakistan, whether with or without leave, \na government servant ceases to be in government employ. It would therefore be in their \nown interest if the government servants who are serv ing abroad on their own with private \norganizations or on foreign service terms ensure that the period of 5 years continuous \nabsence from duty in Pakistan if not exceeded without proper government sanction.  \n 3.  The Ministries and Divisions are requested to  review immediately the \ncases of the government servants under their administrative control who have been \ncontinuously absent from their duty owing to their employment with organizations \noutside Pakistan either on their own or on foreign service terms and take steps to ensure \nthat those who have completed 5 years period return immediately to their duty in Pakistan \nfailing which they shall cease to be in government employ under F.R. 18 except where \ntheir absence in excess of 5 years is covered by proper gove rnment sanction or where \nthey are bound by some terms of contract which should be produced by them.

It is stated that the period of deputation of non -\ndiplomatic officers posted in Pakistan Missions abroad should not be more than 3 years.  \n 2.  According to the current practice, while deputation of these officers is \napproved by the Special Selection Board and  the Prime Minister, the extensions in their \ndeputation period are being granted by the Ministries/Divisions concerned themselves.

To maintain uniformity in granting extensions to the officers posted against \nPakistani posts abroad, it has been decided that extension for a period of one year may \ncontinue to be allowed by the Min istries/ Divisions in deserving cases.  However, cases \ninvolving extension beyond one year should henceforth be put up to the Special Selection \nBoard for decision.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division ‘s O.M.

It is \nobserved that the controlling Ministries/Divisions in disregard to the above instruct ions \ndo not process cases of recalling of /and or granting extension to officers on deputation to \nPakistan ‘s positions abroad well in time resulting in inordinate delays and lapses. \nBesides, most of the cases of extension beyond one year are referred to th e Special \nSelection Board (SSB) at the eleventh hour by the Ministry/Division concerned and they \nalso fail to select a substitute for the said post within the stipulated time. The Prime \nMinister has taken a serious view of such delays/negligence and it has  therefore been \ndecided to direct the administrative/controlling Ministries/Divisions that the following \nstandard operating procedures with regard to recalling of and or granting extension to \nofficers on deputation to Pakistan ‘s position abroad shall be st rictly observed to avoid \nsuch failures in future: — \ni. The normal tenure of posting in Pakistan Missions abroad deputation \nagainst permanent seats of Pakistan in International Organizations shall be \nthree years.   \nii. No Ministry should extend the period of deputa tion invariably all such \ncases where an extension in deputation is essential or required under any \nspecific circumstances should be referred to SSB at least 08 months before \nthe end of tenure. The SSB shall consider the request on merit and furnish \nits rec ommendations for orders of Prime Minister within 30 days.

The parent/administrative/controlling Ministry/Division shall both issue a \nrecall not ice at least 06 months prior to the end of tenure and also start the \nprocess of selection of replacement. Failure to do either of the two things \nshall be considered a failure of the Secretary of the Ministry/Division \nconcerned.  \niv. Medical reasons/study of chi ldren abroad should not be considered a \njustification for extension.   \nv. The parent Ministries/Divisions will remain vigilant regarding tenure and \nrecalling of their officers on deputation abroad. In case no reference for \nextension is received or the request  of the controlling Ministry/Division for \nextension has not been consented, as the case may be, the parent \nMinistry/Division will issue a recall notice to the officer at least six months \nbefore expiry of the normal period of deputation.  \nvi. Such recall notices  in respect of officers belonging to Pakistan \nAdministrative Service (PAS), Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), \nSecretariat Group and Office Management Group will be issued by the \nrespective wings of the Establishment Division holding administrative \ncontrol of these service groups/cadres at least six months before expiry of \nthe normal period of deputation.  \n 2.

After \nexpiry of the approved period of deputation,  the deputationist is required to come back \nand resume duty in the country.  \n 2.  While on deputation abroad, a civil servant was considered for promotion \nin accordance with his seniority position but actual promotion took place after he \nresumed duty on ret urn to Pakistan. This enabled such civil servants to regain their \nseniority ‗vis-à-vis‘ their juniors on actual promotion.  Experience has shown that despite \npromotion, these officers seldom return even on completion of their approved deputation \nperiod.  B y the time they return, many officers have lost their utility and experience \nrelevant to service needs. Promoting such officers immediately on return may not, \ntherefore, be in public interest.  \n 3.  It has, therefore, been decided with the approval of the P resident that :- \n  Page - 598                          ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -6                      \n \n  (i) Promotion of a civil servant on deputation to an international agency, \nforeign government or private organization abroad will only be considered \nafter he resumes duty on return to Pakistan.  \n (ii) Such officers may be given timely intim ation to return so that they can \nearn at least one annual confidential report before their cases come up for \nconsideration in accordance with their seniority position.  \n     (iii) If an officer returns, his case will be considered for promotion in the \nnorm al course.  If he does not return in response to such intimation, his \ncase will be deferred till he returns to Pakistan on comp letion of 5 years \nand earns a confidential report on his work for one full year after \nresuming duty. If approved for promotion,  he will regain his original \nseniority.  \n 4.  Government may allow an officer to continue against his assignment \nabroad even after the expiry of 5 years on the request of the officer or his employer.  \nHowever, in all such cases, the officer ‘s names will be removed from the existing \nSeniority List and placed on a separate Static list with no claim to promotion or to \nseniority over any junior who may be promoted during this period.  An officer ‘s name \nwould be brought back on the Seniority List only after he re sumes duty on return.  In \nsuch cases also, the officer must earn a **confidential report for one full year before he is \nconsidered for promotion. If approved for promotion he will not regain his seniority.  He \nwill be assigned seniority in the higher post only from the date he assumes its charge.  \n 5.

Div. OM No. 5/2/2001 -T-TV, dated 28th January, 2002 on the \nabove subject.  Finance Division is of the view that the deployment of police personnel in \nUN Missions cannot be considered as deputation to foreign service unless they pay these \npersonnel, the salary, allowances and other facilities.  Deployment of personnel in UN \nMissions means that the person will go out of the cadre. The cadre means under FR 9(4) \nthe strength of a service or a part of a service sanctioned as a separate unit. According to  \nFR 9(7), foreign service means the service i n which the government servant receives his \nsubstantive pay with the sanction of the Government from any source other than the \nrevenue of the Governor General or of a province etc. ―If we consider these police \nofficials on foreign service, they cannot be paid salary and other facilities from the \nrevenues of the Government of Pakistan. Moreover, UN is allowing them subsistence \ngrant. When the subsistence grant is allowed to a government servant by a foreign \nmission, he cannot be paid the salary from revenue s of Government of Pakistan. The \nprovision of FR -9(27) is as under:  \n―Subsistence grant means a monthly grant made to a Government servant \nwho is not in receipt of pay or leave salary ‖. \n 2.  In view of this provision in the financial rules, the police offic ials sent to \nserve the UN Missions cannot claim or cannot be paid the salary from the revenues of \nGovernment of Pakistan, in this case the concerned Police Department. They can claim \npay from the Government of Pakistan or Police Department concerned when t hey serve \nunder the Government of Pakistan. The rule position has been clarified under FR -9(28) as \nunder:  \n―The substantive pay means the pay other than special pay, personal pay \nor emoluments classed by pay by the Governor General under rule 9(21) \n(a) (iii ) to which a Government servant is entitled on account of a post to \nwhich he has been appointed substantively or by reasons of his \nsubstantive position in a cadre ‖. \n When a police personnel is serving in the UN Mission, he is not serving against \nhis substa ntive post or substantive post or substantive position in a cadre. He cannot be \npaid pay from the general revenue of Government of Pakistan.  \n 3.  From the provisions of above rules, it is clear that police personnel sent to \nserve the UN Missions cannot cla im pay from Government of Pakistan as they did not \nserve the Government of Pakistan as they did not serve the Government of Pakistan or in \ntheir cadre. Moreover, since they will be in receipt of subsistence grant or allowance they \ncannot be paid salary. Th eir period of duty in UN Mission will also not be counted for the \npurpose of pension unless they pay pension contribution. This period will also not count \nfor the maintenance of leave account. They are also required to contribute towards GP \nFund etc. Howev er as a special compensation the government may allow the families of \nsuch police personnel to retain the government accommodation and medical facilities.  \n                                                           \n President; Revenues of Government of P akistan.  \n   CHAPTER -6                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 609 \n \n  4.   In view of above, Establishment Division is requested to reconsider the \nproposed terms and cond itions of police personnel so as to bring these in line with the \nrules.  \n5.

CAREER PLANNING  \n 1.1 Preparation of Seniority Lists BPS Wise  \n  According to sub -section (1) of section 8 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, seniority \nlists of all persons employed under the Federal Government are required to be prepared.  After \npromulgation of the All -Pakistan Services (Change in Nomenclature) Rules, 1973, and the \nCivil Servants (Change in Nomenclature of Services and Ab olition of Classes) Rules, 1973, \nthe former regularly constituted Services ceased to exist.  Seniority lists of all officers \nemployed under the Federal Government including officers belonging to the former regularly \nconstituted Services, should, therefore b e re-drawn grade -wise. In the case of appointments \nmade by promotion, seniority in a particular grade would be determined according to sub -\nsection (4), of section 8 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, namely, according to the date of \nregular appointment to a post in that  grade, subject to the proviso that civil servants selected \nfor promotion to a higher grade in one batch shall, on their promotion, retain their inter-se-\nseniority  in the lower grade unless superseded.  As for seniority between departmental \npromotees and direct recruits in grades where posts are filled both by promotion and direct \nrecruitment, the rule already prescribed in the general principles of seniority in Establishment \nDivision O.M. No. 1/16/69 -D.II, dated 31st December, 1970 shall conti nue to be followed.  \nAccording to these rules officers promoted to a higher grade in a continuous arrangement and \nas a regular measure in a particular year shall, as a class, be senior to those appointed by direct \nrecruitment in the same year.  \n 2. The Esta blishment Division have already issued gradation lists in respect of  \nBPS 18 and above of the **All-Pakistan Unified Grades.  As for Federal Unified Grades, the \nMinistries/Divisions are requested to prepare gradation lists for each occupational group \nunder  their administrative control.

It was provided that in the case of appointments made by promotion, \nseniority in a particular grade should be determined accordin g to sub -section (4) of \nsection 8 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, namely from the date of regular appointment to \na post in a grade.  \n 2.  A number of references have been received in the Establishment Division \nenquiring whether the seniorities in various g rades which had already been established \naccording to the previous rules on the subject differently from the principle of date of \nregular appointment to a grade could not be modified in accordance with the provisions \nof sub -section (4) of section 8 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973.  The matter has been \nexamined in consultation with the Law Division.  The position is that consequent upon \nthe Administrative Reforms, certain cadres have been transformed into occupational \ngroups but the composition of the cadres  comprising these groups has remained intact.  \nExamples are; the Income Tax Group, the Customs and Excise Group, the Military \nLands and Cantonments Group etc. However, in the case of certain other groups for \nexample the Accounts Group and the Secreta riat Group - a number of cadres have been \n                                                           \n Now renamed as ―Inland Revenue Service‖ vide Estt.

In the case of groups where the cadre has not \nbeen amalgamated with any other cadre, the seniority in different grades as determined \nunder the previous rules before the pro mulgation of the Civil Servants Ordinance, 1973 \n(15-8-1973) shall not be disturbed.  However, seniority of persons promoted to higher \ngrades after 15 -8-1973 shall be determined strictly in accordance with the provisions of \nsub-section (4) of section 8 of t he Civil Servants Act, 1973.  \n 3. In regard to occupational groups which have been formed by \namalgamating more than one cadre, no such protection of seniority is either permissible \nor practicable.  The old cadres having ceased to exist, the seniorities in t he newly formed \ngroups have to be determined afresh and shall be fixed in accordance with the date of \nregular appointment to posts in the respective grades.  \n 4.

Each administrative Secretary may be made responsible fo r ensuring \nimplementation of the above decision by making internal adjustment of staff. If any \nofficer/staff becomes redundant to the requirement of the Ministries/  Divisions/Departments \nas a result of implementation of the above or any other decision, tha t may be enlisted with the \nsurplus pool for adjustment elsewhere. As a result of implementation of the above said \ndecisions, the number of surplus civil servants will increase manifold.  \n 3. In terms of Section 11(2) of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, the services of civil \nservants holding temporary and permanent posts can be terminated on abolition of such posts. \nHowever, on human considerations, government decided in 1993 to create a surplus pool \nunder the charge of the Establishment Division. The civil s ervants declared surplus as a result \nof abolition of posts are enlisted in the surplus pool for absorption elsewhere.  \n 4. In order to speed -up the pace of absorption of surplus civil servants, \nfollowing guidelines have been framed with approval of the comp etent authority, for \neffective administration of the surplus pool: – \n (i) The name of a civil servant, other than ad -hoc employees and persons \nappointed against leave and deputation vacancies, who may be rendered \nsurplus as a result of reorganization or abo lition of a Division/  \nDepartment/Organization or reduction in the number of posts shall be placed \nin the surplus pool administered by Establishment Division for a period of two \nyears whereafter his services shall stand terminated. If a civil servant has \nalready completed two years in the surplus pool on the date of issuance of \nguidelines, he may be allowed to remain enlisted in the pool for a period of \nanother one year whereafter his services shall stand terminated.  \n (ii) If a post occupied by a deputationi st or a person posted under Section 10 \nof Civil Servants Act, 1973 is declared surplus, the holder of the post shall \nbe repatriated to his parent organization.  \n (iii) During the period of his placement in the Surplus Pool a civil servant shall \nremain on th e pay rolls of his parent department and he shall be entitled to \npay and allowances which he would have drawn in the post last held by \nhim on regular basis in his parent organization before his placement in the \nPool. His post in his parent department shall  be treated as supernumerary \npost and it shall be abolished after his absorption or the period mentioned \nin sub -para(i) above, whichever be earlier.  \n                                                           \nNow Prime Minister.  \nPage - 626                             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                CHAPTER -7                   \n \n  (iv) During placement in the surplus pool, civil servants may be given the \noption to avail leave under rul e 27 of the Revised Leave Rules 1980.  \n (v) Civil servants placed in the surplus pool shall be posted for absorption in \nother Divisions/Departments/Organizations in accordance with rules 3(3) \nand 3(4)  of the Civil Servants (Appoint ment, Promotion and Transf er) \nRules, 1973 and Section 11 -A of the Civil Servants Act, 1973.  \n (vi) Surplus employees in BPS 1 – 5 shall, ordinarily, be posted for absorption \nat the station of their last posting or place of domicile. Civil servants in \nBPS 6 and above may be posted a t a station other than the station of their \nlast posting or domicile but subject to availability of posts, efforts may be \nmade to arrange their posting nearest to the station of their last posting or \ntheir place of domicile.  \n (vii) Failure of a surplus ci vil servant to join new post within the prescribed time \nshall render him liable to removal from the list of surplus pool and termination \nof his services. Where the competent authority is satisfied that failure of \nsurplus civil servant to report for duty at  the place of his new posting within \nthe prescribed time was in circumstances beyond his control, it may, for \nreasons to be recorded in writing, allow him additional time for joining or \nconsider him for alternative posting at a station other than the one t o which he \nwas last posted.   \n (viii)  If a Division/Department/Organization fails to accept the services of a \ncivil servant transferred from surplus pool, the post shall be deemed to \nhave been abolished.  \n (ix) Legal provision for termination, reversion, E& D proceeding, etc shall be \ninvoked only after the surplus civil servant fails to abide by the \ngovernment orders within the given time -frame.  \n 5. As regards employees of the autonomous bodies, they are not civil servants and \nare governed by the regulations/ instructions operative in each individual organization. Each \nMinistry/Division should, therefore, lay down a policy in consultation with the Finance Division \nfor disposal of surplus employees of the autonomous bodies under its administrative control.  \n 6. All Ministries/Divisions are req uested to comply with the above \ninstructions/guidelines strictly.  \n 7. This supersedes all the instructions issued on the subject from time to time.  \n[Authority. – Estt.

However, those surplus employees who \n  CHAPTER -7                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021 )                               Page - 627 \n \n are willing to proceed on retirement may be allowed all admissible service benefits like \nleave, pension/gratuity etc under the normal rules.  \n 2. In order to implement the dire ctive of the Prime Minister, all \nMinistries/Divisions are requested to comply with the following instructions: — \na) The services of surplus civil servants shall not be terminated by the \nMinistries/Divisions /Departments. They will continue to work in \nrespec tive departments and get their salaries etc. till absorption elsewhere.  \nb) Surplus employees, who are willing to proceed on retirement, may be \ndischarged retired (depending on the length of service) and allowed all \nadmissible service benefit like leave, pe nsion/gratuity etc under the normal \nrules.  \nc) Ministries/Divisions may immediately report available vacancies for direct \nrecruitment in Ministries/Divisions/ Departments for absorption of surplus \nemployees. They shall continue obtaining clearance from Establishment \nDivision before resorting to direct recruitment.  \nd) Absorption orders issued by Establishment Division may be implement \nwithout delay through consultation between the old and the new \ndepartments of the surplus employees. The surplus employees  are regular \ncivil servants, appointed through prescribed selection processes like \ntests/interviews etc, they cannot be put through another selection process \nby the new departments.  \n3.

The following illustration/  \nelaboration f urther clarify the position:  \nPERs for one full year shall imply, one full year PER(s) earned after \nconsideration/supersession by the Selection Board and will include the \nPER which was neither due no r placed before the Selection Board even if \nit relates to the previous year.  \nIllustration -I \nIf an officer ‗A‘ is considered by the Selection Board in Jan,2019 when \nhis/her PER for 2018 is neither due nor placed before the Selection Board \nand superseded. He will be considered after earning one full year PERs \nfor 2 018. \nIllustration -II \nIf an officer ‗B‘ is considered by the Selection Board in January,2019 \nwhen his/her PER for 2018 is not due but placed before the Selection \nBoard and superseded. He/she will be considered after earning one full \nyear PERs for 201 9. \nIllustration -III \nIf an officer ‗C‘ is considered by the Selection Board in May,2019 when \nhis/her PER for 2018 is due and placed before the Board and superseded. \nHe will be considered after earning the PER of 2019.  \n(d) Posts carrying basic pay scale 19 are generally supervisory posts. \nSupervision can be effective only if the supervisor has the relevant \nexperience. These officers are also required to make contribution to \npolicy -making at the lowest rung of the policy -making hierarchy. For \npromotion to these p osts, therefore, a civil servant must fulfill qualifying \nservice, eligibility threshold, qualifications, training, relevance of \nexperience, quality and output of work and integrity.  \n  CHAPTER -7                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021 )                               Page - 647 \n \n (e) Posts carrying basic pay scale 20 are middle management posts. Field \noffic es are generally headed by the officers in this scale. It is, therefore, \nessential that in addition to the relevance of experience these officers \nmust also have a sufficient variety and width of experience so that:  \n(i) they acquire an overview of  the functions  performed by these  \n    organizations with in the broader framework of government ‘s \n   overall objectives/ activities to ensure smooth and effective  \n   management at the field level; and  \n(ii) they can lend pragmatism to policy formulation in assignment s at \nthe Secretariat. Variety of experience would include experience in \nthe field, corporations, attached departments, different Ministries/ \nDivisions and in our Missions abroad.  \nFor promotion to middle management posts, a civil servant must \nfulfill qualif ying service, eligibility threshold, qualifications, \nrelevance of experience, quality and output of work  and \nintegrity, variety of experience and training.  \nSelection Board should give due consideration to the nature of \nduties, duration and location of pos ts previously held by the \nofficer. Depending on the post to be filled, an officer possessing \nwell rounded experience should normally be preferred \nparticularly if he /she has served with distinction in unattractive \nareas. While some exposure to a corporatio n, autonomous body \nor an ex -cadre assignment may be considered a positive feature, \nthis would not be so where an officer has stayed away from \nhis/her parent cadre for too long.  \n(f) Posts carrying basic pay scale 21 fall in senior management involving \nimportant  policy -making or extensive administrative jurisdictions. In \naddition to the circulation value and variety of experience the incumbents \nmust possess proven analytical competence, breadth of vision, emotional \nmaturity and such other qualities as determine t he potential for \nsuccessfully holding posts in top management. This potential cannot be \njudged by mathematical formula. The Selection Board will have to apply \nits collective judgment to determine the same.  \nFor promotion to senior management posts, a civil  servant must fulfill \nqualifying service, eligibility threshold, qualifications, relevance of \nexperience, quality and output of work and integrity, variety of \nexperience, training and Top Management Potential.  \nSince officers promoted to this level may be called upon to hold \nindependent charge of a Ministry/Division or to head a major corporation, \nthe board should satisfy itself about the officer ‘s maturity, balance and \nability to assume such top management positions even at short notice.  \n \n \nPage - 648                             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                CHAPTER -7                   \n \n SCHEDULE -II \n[See rule 6 (1) (a)]  \nMINIMUM LENGTH OF SERVICE FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR PROMOTION TO \nPOSTS IN VARIOUS BPS  \n In pursuance of rule 8 -A of the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion and \nTransfer) Rules,1973  and in supersession of the instructions laid down in the \nEstablishment Division ‘s O.M No. 1/9/80 R.II (A), dated the 12th January,1981, the \nPresident is pleased to decide that the minimum length of service for promotion to \nvarious basic pay scales shall b e as follows: — \n - For BPS 18    5 years in BS 17  \n - For BPS 19    12 years in BS 17 and above  \n - For BPS 20    17 years in BS 17 and above  \n - For BPS 21    22 years in BS 17 and above  \n - For BPS 22  25 years in BS 17 & above and 02 years in \nBS 21  \n  Provided that:— \n(i) Where initial appointment of a person not being a person in government \nservice, takes place in a post in BPS 18, 19 or 20, the length of service \nspecified in this Office Memorandum shall be reduced by the following \nperiods;  \nFirst appointment in   Reduced by  \nBPS-18    5 years  \nBPS-19    12 years  \nBPS-20    17 years  \n(ii) Where initial appointment of a person already in government service \ntakes place, on recommendations of the Federal Public Service \nCommission, in a post in BPS 18,19 or 20, the length of ser vice specified \nin this Office Memorandum shall be reduced by the periods specified in \nprovision (i);  \n(iii) Where first appointment of a person other than a person covered by \nproviso (ii) was made to government service in BPS 16 or below, one -\nhalf of the service in BPS 16 and one fourth in BPS 15 and below may be \ncounted as service in BPS 17 for computing length  of service for the \npurpose of promotion only.  \n \n \n \n \n  CHAPTER -7                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021 )                               Page - 649 \n \n SCHEDULE -III \n(See rule 18 (1)]  \nQUANTIFYING THE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION REPORTS  \n1.

(a) The overall gradings in the PERs are allocated the following marks:  \n  Overall Grading    Marks  \n   (i) Outstanding    10 \n   (ii) Very Good    8 \n   (iii) Good    7   \n   (iv) Average    5 \n   (v) Below Average   1 \n (b) If the overall grading in a PER is ambiguous e.g. placed between ‗Good ‘ \n   and ‗Average ‘, the PER will be returned to R.O/ C.O for clarification.   \n (c) In case the assessment of the countersigning of ficer differs from that of the \nreporting officer in any PER , the quantification will be based on the \noverall  grading re corded by the countersigning officer.  \n (d) In case where there is a second  countersi gning officer, the  quantification  \nwill be based on the ov erall grading recorded by the second \ncountersigning officer.  \n (e) Where two or more performance evaluation reports were initiated in a \ncalendar year, the marks for that year shall be quantified as the sum of the \nweighted averages of these PERs.  \n (f) Where an officer, appointed to a higher post on acting charge basis, is \nconsidered for regular promotion to that post, the PERs earned during his \nacting charge appointment will be added to the PERs earne d in the lower \npost for calculating average marks.  \n3. The marks for PERs shall be computed separately for each grade/level of \nposts carrying the same basic pay scale and a weighted aggregate score will be worked \nout as follows:  \na) For each calendar year earning 02 or more PERs vide 2 (e), part  report in \n a calendar year will be quantified on the basis of weightage average \n proportionately, instead of their arithmetic mean / average, to determine \n the yearly score of PERs.  \nb) To cal culate the PER scores in a Basic Pay Scale/Grade, the  average \n of all the yearly scores will be taken.  \nc) Weightage will be applied to the PER score and training score for \n computing the aggregate score, as per clauses (a), (b) & (e) of  sub-rule \n 3 of rul e 18 and as per rule 20.  \nPage - 650                             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                CHAPTER -7                   \n \n d) The following addition / deductions shall be made in the total marks \n worked out:  \n A.

Once the officer has been promoted to the higher grade no \ndeduction shall be made subsequently.  \n Example No. 1  \nAn officer is being considered for promotion to BPS 19. He was awarded a \nminor penalty in BPS 18. Deduction of 3 marks shall be made from his total \nquantification whenever his case comes for promotion to BPS 19. Till such time \nthat he is promoted to the ne xt grade (i.e. BPS 19 in this case) his overall \nquantification shall worked out with deduction of 3 marks.  \n Example No. 2  \nThe same officer is now being considered for promotion to BPS -20. He was \nawarded minor penalty in BPS 18 and was subs equently promot ed to BPS -19. \nWhile calculating his quantification for promotion to BPS -19, deduction of 3 \nmarks was made from his total quantification. However, now that the officer has \nbeen promoted to BPS 19 and is being considered for promotion to BPS 20 no \ndeduction shall be made from his total quantification.    \n―[Exemption from Training  \n Subject to clause (e) of sub -rule (3) of rule 18, if an officer is exempted from one or \nboth trainings on the basis of either belonging to a specialist cadre or on attaining a certain age \nas given in rule 21 of these rules, his training score for the respective training or trainings shall \nbe placed at the disposal of the CSB or the DSB, as the case may be .; and]  \n[**] \n**[***********]  \nEndorsement of Quantification Score  \n To maintaining 100% accuracy in the process of quantification of the PERs, \nfollowing process shall be adopted:  \n(a) the quantification sheets shall be signed by the official designated to do so, \nbesides its countersignature by a responsible supervising officer; an d \n(b) that any incorrect quantification identified during the course of inspection \nor re-verification shall be treated as an act of inefficiency and misconduct \npunishable under the Efficiency and Discipline Rules, besides liability \nunder the criminal law.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \nSubstituted vide Establishment Division S.R.O No. 58(I)/2020 dated 25 -01-2020.  \n \n The heading ―Single Training‖ and the provision thereunder has been omitted vide S.R.O No.58(I)/2020 \ndated 25 -01-2020.  \nPage - 652                             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                CHAPTER -7                   \n \n Schedule -IV \n[See rule 18(3)(c)]  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \nGOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN  \nMINISTRY/DIVISION_________________  \nOBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT BY CENTRAL/DEPARTMENTAL \nSELECTION BOARD  \nOfficer ‘s Name:_________________   Seniority No.:______________  \nGroup/Service/Cadre:________________   Present Scale:_______________  \nSr. \nNo. Parameters/Attributes  Total Marks  \n30 Marks \nAssigned  \n1.

The replies received from the Ministries and Divisions on the suggestions \ncontained in the above Memorandum have been considered and, in order to ensure that \ncandidates rejected by the Federal Public Service Commission in open competition or \nselection should not be absorbed in vacancies meant for departmental quotas, it has been \ndecided that the following procedure should be adopted in future: - \n(i) where a cadre has definite quotas reserved for departmental promotions \nand direct rec ruitment, promotions against the departmental quota should \nbe made first and the posts reserved for direct recruitment filled later.  \nThese orders, however, will have no effect on those cadres where \nrecruitment is made solely by direct recruitment or where  all appointments \nare made only by promotion;  \n(ii) necessary provision regarding the above should be made in all recruitment \nrules already framed or framed hereafter; and  \n(iii) in the case of isolated posts, a roster should be maintained in each \nMinistry and Division  to ensure the observance of the prescribed \npercentage for departmental promotions and direct recruitment.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

No. 15/38/52 -SE II, dated the  \n22nd June, 1953]  \n In the case of services and cadres in which under the prescribed recruitment rules a \ncertain percentage of vacancies is reserved for departmental promotion and the remainder for \ndirect recruitment, no uniform procedure is followed as to the sequence in which these \nvacancies should be filled, that is, whether promotions should be made first and direct \nrecruitment made later or vice versa. The Establishment Division have been considering the \nquestion of laying down a unifo rm procedure in this matter and have tentatively come to the \nconclusion that it would be an advantage both from the point of view of the department as \nwell as the candidates if promotions are made first and vacancies reserved for direct \nrecruitment filled later. There are, however, advantages and disadvantages on both sides, and \nthese are discussed below:  \n(i) Promotions to departmental quota to be made first and direct recruitment \nmade later:  \n Under this system the department concerned can straight away pro mote the \nsuitable departmental candidates and, having done so, intimate the vacancies meant for \ndirect recruitment to the Federal Public Service Commission. If all the vacancies reserved \nfor promotion cannot be filled due to the dearth of suitable departme ntal candidates the \nbalance can, if necessary, be added to those reserved for direct recruitment. This system \nassures promotion to the candidates working in the department according to the principle \nof seniority -cum-fitness without undue delay and they are  not left in suspense as to \nwhether or not they should apply to the Commission. If any of the departmental \ncandidates are superseded in departmental promotion, they still have a chance to compete \nwith outside candidates and may, thereby, be selected as bei ng more suitable in \ncomparison with such candidates. This system, therefore, assures promotion to \ndepartmental candidates without their having to wait till the vacancies, etc., are \nadvertised by the Commission, while those superseded in departmental promot ion can \nstill appear before the Commission.  \n A further advantage from the point of view of departmental men is that they \nwill rank senior to outside candidates selected through direct recruitment as their \nappointments can be finalized earlier than those o f the later.  \n A disadvantage which might result from this system is that it may not always be \npossible in actual practice to follow it due to the exigencies of service which may, in \ncertain cases, necessitate direct recruitment being made first and appoint ments by \ndepartmental promotion later.  Such cases, as far as can be seen, are likely to be rare and on \nthe whole it appears that there are definite advantages in following the system whereby \nrecruitment against the departmental quota should precede that t hrough open selection.  \n(ii) Recruitment by open selection to be made first and by departmental \npromotions later:  \n                                                           \n employees; candidates.  \n  CHAPTER -7                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021 )                               Page - 671 \n \n  One of the results of this procedure will be that larger number of open vacancies \nwill go to departmental candidates in as much as they will be able in the first place to \ncompete with outsiders in open selection and be approved by the Commission on the \nbasis of their long experience and knowledge of the department. Those who are not \nselected in the open selection can again be considered for dep artmental promotion and \nreceive promotion according to departmental seniority. This system, however, is bound to \nresult in deterioration of efficiency since those who are not considered fit by the \nCommission can still be appointed to higher posts by depart mental promotion and the \nadvantage of having fresh blood in the service which the open selection quota in a service \nis intended to provide will be seriously jeopardized. Apart from the resultant \ndeterioration, this system has a further grave objection inas much as a person rejected by \nthe Commission would still be able to secure a like post through departmental promotion.  \n 2. The Federal Public Service Commission, who raised this matter, have \nsuggested that departments should first promote the deserving indi viduals against the \nquota fixed for promotion and then throw open the remaining posts for open competition. \nIn accordance with this procedure, no one who has been rejected by the Commission or \nhas not faced any competition will be promoted.  This is eviden tly sound in principle.       \n             3. Considering all the facts, the Establishment Division are of the view that \nthe alternative at (i) above has definite advantages from the point of view of efficiency in \npublic service and the safeguarding of the  legitimate interests of the departmental \ncandidates and they are, therefore, inclined to issue orders for its adoption by all \nMinistries/ Divisions/Departments. Before, however, a final decision is taken, Ministries \nand Divisions are requested kindly to f avour the Establishment Division with their views \nin the matter.  \n 6.1 Minimum Length of Service for Eligibility  \nfor Promotion to Posts in Various BPS \n In pursuance of rule 8 -A of the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion and \nTransfer) Rules, 1973 and in supersession of the instructions laid down in the Establishment \nDivision ‘s O.M.No.1/9/80 R.II(A), dated the 12th January, 1981, (Annex) , the President is \npleased to decide that the minimum length of service for promotion to various grades shall \nbe as follo ws:- \n-  For BS 18    5 years in BS 17  \n-  For BS 19        12 years in BS 17 and above  \n-  For BS 20    17 years in BS 17 and above  \n-  For BS 21    22 years in BS 17 and above  \n -  *For BS 22  25 years in BS 17 & above and   \n02 years in BS 21  \n Provided that: - \n(i) Where initial appointment of a person not being a person in government \nservice, takes place in a post in BPS 18, 19 or 20, the length of service \n                                                           \n* Amended vide Notification 7/1/2010.

A point has since been raised whether ad -hoc service rendered in a post followed \nby regular appointment to that post may be allowed to be computed towards length of service \nprescribed for promotion to a higher post.  The matter has been considered in the \nEstablishm ent Division.  It has been decided that the service rendered on ad -hoc basis in a \npost under the Federal Government, followed by regular appointment to a post in the same \npay scale shall be counted towards length of service prescribed for promotion to a hi gher post \nprovided there is no break between ad -hoc and regular appointments to the post concerned.  \n 2. The above decision may be brought to the notice of all departments/ \norganizations under the administrative control of Ministries/ Divisions.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Division ‘s O.M.No.10/22/83 -R.2, dated 20 -3-1988].  \n 6.3 Counting of Service Rendered Against Higher Post  \nUnder Section 10 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973  \n Section 10 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 reads as under: — \n ―10. Posting and transfer: —Every civil servant shall be liable to serve \nanywhere within or outside Pakistan in any equivalent or higher post under the \nFederal Government or any Provincial Government or local authority or a \ncorporation or body set up or established by any s uch Government;  \n Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply to a civil servant \nrecruited specifically to serve in a particular area or region.  \n Provided further that where a civil servant is required to serve in a post outside \nhis service or cadre his terms and conditions of service as to his pay shall not be less \nfavourable than those to which he would have been entitled if he had not been so required \nto serve ‖. \n 2. A point was raised how the service rendered by a civil servant posted \nagainst a higher post under Section 10 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 would be counted \nfor the purpose of promotion to higher post of the said civil servant.  \n 3. The matter has been given careful consideration in the Establishment \nDivision. It has been observ ed that according to section 5 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 \nall appointments are required to be made in the prescribed manner i.e. on the \nrecommendations of appropriate Departmental Promotion / Selection Committee (s) or \nBoard(s), as the case may be, an d with the approval of the designated appointing authorities \nfollowed by a notification promoting such civil servant to higher BPS.   \n 4. Section 10 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 is a liability provision i.e. a \ncivil servant is liable to serve in an equiv alent or higher post. Promotion to a higher post \nand holding temporary charge of a post are two different aspects. Legally, a person is not \nin a higher grade until his promotion to the higher post is duly notified and charge of the \nhigher post is formally assumed by him.  \nPage - 674                             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                CHAPTER -7                   \n \n  5. It has, therefore, been decided that the service rendered by a civil servant \nagainst higher post under Section 10 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 cannot be treated at \npar with the service rendered by regularly promoted officers in the h igher scale for the \npurpose of promotion to the next higher grade.  \n 6. The decision may be brought to the notice of all concerned.  \n[Authority: Estab. Div. ‘s OM No. 3/40/2007 -R-2, dated 12th Nov., 2007]  \n 6.4 Length of Service for Promotion from  \nBPS-16 to BPS-18 Where There is No  \nIntermediate Post in BPS -17 \n The minimum length of service for promotion to BPS 18 and above was laid down \nvide Establishment Division ‘s Office Memorandum No.1/9/80 -R.II, dated 12th January, 1981 \n(Sl.No. 6.1 Annex ). The question as  to what should be the length of service for promotion \nfrom BPS 16 to BPS 18 where there is no intermediate post in BPS 17 has been considered \nand it has been decided, with the approval of the President, that in such cases the minimum \nlength of service lai d down in the recruitment rules relating to posts in BPS 18 for the \npurpose of promoti on from BPS 16 to BPS 18 should be kept as the basis for such \npromotions.  \n 2. In case there is no such provision in the recruitment rules, action should be \ntaken by the r espective Ministry/Division to include such a provision in the recruitment rules.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

Where a senior person has not done \nprescribed service, the junior, as a rule, should not be considered even if he fulfills the \nprescribed length of service condition.  \n 2. Even for ―selection ‖ post, the persons have to be considered in the order of \ntheir seniority.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Division ‘s U.O.

However, the level at which the composition is to be approved in \nthe Ministry concerned has not been specified.  \n 2.  It has, therefore, been dec ided that composition of the Departmental \nPromotion Committee for BPS 11 to 18 may be approved at the level of Secretary of a \nMinistry/Division and the composition of Departmental Promotion Committees for BPS 10 \nand below may be approved by the Joint Secre tary.

It is clarified that all cases in which a post in Basic Pay \nScale 18 carrying some special pay is filled b y promotion will be placed before the \nappropriate Departmental Promotion Committee*.  Where post in Pay Scale 18 carrying a \nspecial pay does not fall in the promotion ladder, it would be filled by departmental heads \nthrough normal posting and transfer.  \n[Authority:– Estt.

In \ncertain cases Government servants officiating without any condition in higher BPS have been \ndemoted on the recommendation of Departmental Promotion Committees. It is necessary, \ntherefore, that the position should be clarified.  \n 2.  As their name indicates, the function of Departmental Promotion \nCommittees is to make recommendations in respect of promotions and there is nothing in \nEstablishment Division Office Memorandum No. 33/l/47 -Ests(SE.II), dated the 29th Janua ry, \n1948 which relates to the constitution of these Committees, to suggest that these Committees \nhave been given the power to recommend the demotion of an officiating officer.  \n                                                           \n*BPS.

What Departmental Promotion Committees should do is to prepare a list \nof officers whom they consider fit for promotion. They should revise this list periodically \nwhich means that they can either add to, or substract from it. An officer who has been \nsubstantively promoted to a higher BPS will not of course figure in this list.  Similarly, an \nofficer who has been promoted to officiate in a substantive vacancy for an indefinite \nperiod should not appear in the list because he is for all practical purposes to continue in \nthe higher BPS.  In other words, the officers whose names will be shown in the list \nmaintained by these Committees will be those who have not been promoted to higher \nBPS in any capacity or who have officiated off and on or who are officiating against \nleave vacancies or in temporary posts of short duration and are, the refore, liable to revert \nin the normal course to the lower BPS.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

Under the said guidelines, the proposals signed by the \nSecretary/Additional Secretary Incharge and accompanied by prescribed documents d uly \nauthenticated/stamped by responsible officer, are required to be forwarded to the \nEstablishment Division for submission to the *CSB.  \n 2. It has been observed in some cases, however, that the proposals for the \nCentral Selection Boards do not fully confo rm to the laid down requirements on the subject. \nIn some cases, the proposals are not duly signed by the concerned Secretary/ Additional \nSecretary Incharge while, in others, the accompanying documents are either unattested \nand/or carrying incorrect/ incomp lete information. All this leads to avoidable delays on \naccount of back references to the concerned Ministries/Divisions.  \n 3. It has also been observed in many cases that the documents are forwarded at \nthe Section Officer ‘s level and addressed to his count erpart in this Division. Since the Joint \nSecretary (Admn) of the Ministry/Division concerned is the focal point there, such proposals \nfor *CSB must invariably be forwarded under his covering letter after ensuring that all the \nrequisite documents relevant t o this exercise have been prepared and duly signed by the \nconcerned officers. Moreover, with a view to enforcing secrecy as well as prompt attention, \nall such references should, henceforth, be addressed to the Additional Secretary (CP&R), \nEstablishment D ivision, and delivered under a sealed cover. Replies to any query on the part \nof the Establishment Division (which would not be below the level of Deputy Secretary) \nshould also be furnished at least at the same level if not at the level of Joint Secretary \n(Admn).  \n 4. All Ministries/Divisions are requested to kindly ensure that their promotion \nproposals for the consideration of *CSB are forwarded in the light of the \nposition/requirements of paras 2 & 3 above.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No.45/6/90 -CP-3, dated 3 -5-1995].  \n 7.12 Procedure for Referring Cases  \nto the Selection Board  \n It has been observed that proposals relating to the Central Selection Board are not \nbeing sent alongwith the required number of copies each of the essential documents, like the \n―proposal proforma ‖  properly filled in, complete C.R. dossiers of the officers , their \nparticulars of service, bio -data, latest seniority lists (arranged according to the new gradation \nsystem) etc. Moreover, government servants having (former). East Pakistan domicile and the \nrepatriated PSOWs need to be cleared first by the D.I.B. It  is also observed that the \nparticulars of service of the government servants are generally not prepared carefully and the \nC.R. dossiers are not checked to find out the precise reasons for the missing reports.  This has \n                                                           \n Note: -  \n    As CSB -I & CSB -II are no more in practice.  \n Career Planni ng  & Regulations.  \nPage - 692                             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                CHAPTER -7                   \n \n to be ensured in all cases and the la test reports have to be invariably attached to the proposals \nor the reasons for not attaching such reports have to be clearly indicated.  \n 2. At times, big bundles of C.R. dossiers are sent to the residence of the \nSecretary, Central Selection Board. This in volves great risk (apart from inconvenience) as \nbulky bundles, of C.R. dossiers have to be carried from residence to the office.  Moreover, \nthe CR dossiers received just before the meeting cannot be properly checked.  In view of \nthis, it is imperative that  the C.R. dossiers should be sent to the Establishment Division well \nin advance of the date of the meeting of the Central Selection Board after due scrutiny \ninsuring that these are complete in all respects. However, if under extraordinary \ncircumstances the  CR dossiers have to be sent just before the meeting, the \nMinistries/Divisions may kindly arrange to deliver these CR dossiers through special \nmessengers in the office of the Secretary, Central Selection Board before the meeting of the \nBoard in which other  items are to be discussed.  \n 3. The above mentioned requirements should be invariably kept in view while \nsending proposals for the consideration of the Central Selection Board.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Div. ‘s D.O. Letter No.25/7/74 -AV, dated 3 -10-1974].  \n7.13 Consideration of Cases by Central Selection  \nBoard – Furnishing of Full Particulars of  \nCandidates for Promotion  \n It has come to the notice of the Central Selection Board that in certain cases a \nparticular candidate or candidates is/are recommended out of the total number of candidates \nconsidered by the Ministry/Division, without mentioning the full particulars of all the \ncandidates.  The proper procedure in such cases is to place the full particulars of ALL  the \ncandidates before the Central Selection Board  so that the Board may decide which of the \ncandidates are not suitable for the post in question. It is accordingly requested that the full \nparticulars of ALL  the candidates in the field of selection or those who may have been \nconsidered by the administrati ve Ministries/Divisions, should be placed before the Central \nSelection Board in all such cases.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Division ‘s O.M.

It is clarified that grant of BS -17 to Superintendent is not \na promotion within the meaning of Section -9 of the Civil Servant Act,1973, therefore, for all \npractical purposes, the Superintendent granted/placed in BS -17 ar e the substantive holders of \nthe post in BS -16 and are eligible for taking SOPE subject to completion of all other \nconditions/codal formalities.  \n[Authority: — Establishment Division ‘s O.M No. 7/5/2014 -T-V dated 29 -12-2016].  \n 9.1 Proforma Promotions  \n The Ministries and Divisions as well as Attached Departments and Subordinate \nOffices, have, in the past, been ordering proforma promotions (also called promotions in \nabsentia) of persons serving on deputation on foreign service, or in ex -cadre posts as a matte r \nof course on the sole ground that the deputationist had been approved for promotions by the \nD.P.C. of the parent department and a person junior to him had been promoted.  This has \nresulted in the deputationists serving away from their parent department o r cadre for unduly \nlong periods as such persons not only enjoy better emoluments while on deputation but also \nfeel secure that their interests are being fully protected in their own department.  \n 2.  The intention underlying ‗proforma promotions ‘ is to prot ect the interests of \nthe government servant only in circumstances where the government servant is required to \nserve away from his parent cadre because of a definite requirement of public interest and not \nmerely to suit his own interest.  Normally, therefor e, a deputationist, as soon as he becomes \ndue for promotion should be required to revert to his parent department or cadre so that he is \npromoted to the next higher post for which he may have been declared fit.  In case an offer of \npromotion is made to him  and he declines to revert, he may be allowed to remain in the \noutside post on the clear understanding that he will not ask for ‗proforma promotion ‘.  Only \nin exceptional cases where the borrowing department or organization expresses its inability \nto spare  the officer, and the head of the parent department records in writing why he \nconsiders it necessary to keep the government servant on deputation in the ex -cadre \nappointment, may proforma promotions be made.  Even in such cases, the period for which \nthe of ficer is allowed to continue to remain on deputation, with the benefit of proforma \npromotion, should be judiciously fixed so that the officer reverts to his cadre and is appointed \nto the post for which he has been approved for promotion, as early as possib le.  Such period \nshould not normally exceed 6 months.  All cases where ‗proforma promotions ‘ are allowed \n  CHAPTER -7                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021 )                               Page - 697 \n \n for a period exceeding 6 months should be reported to the Establishment Division with full \njustification.  \n 3.  The Ministries/Divisions are also advised that in future whenever they send \nan officer or member of the staff on deputation to an ex -cadre post, or on foreign service, \nthey should settle in advance the period of deputation with the borrowing office/organization \non the expiry of which the g overnment servant should revert to his parent cadre.  While \nselecting persons for deputation, care should also be taken not to depute officers who would \nsoon be coming up or promotion to the next rank in their own cadre and may have to be \nre-called. In the  majority of cases, officers and staff are sent on deputation on their \napplication or request.  They should be warned that in case they fall due for promotion, they \nwill have to revert to their parent cadre and they will not be allowed promotions in absent ia. \n 4.  The above instructions do not apply to senior appointments in international \norganizations such as the United Nations, the R.C.D. Sectt., etc. to which officers are \nnominated by government having regard to their qualifications, experience and suit ability.  \nIn such cases, it may be presumed that the services of the officer have been placed on \ndeputation with the foreign organization in the public interest, and ‗proforma promotion ‘ \nwhen called for, may be made.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

No. 1/28/71 -D.II, dated 29 -7-1971].  \n 9.2 Consideration for Promotion  \nof a Person on Transfer to  \nAnother Office  \n A permanent ministerial government servant, who is temporarily transferred \nfrom one office to another in the public interest, should be considered for promotion to a \nhigher BPS in his parent office as and when a vacancy occurs in the higher BPS and if he \nis selected for promotion in accordance with the relevant rules, he should be appointed \nproforma to the higher BPS so that when he reverts to his parent office he can count, for \nseniority and increments in the higher BPS, the period for which he remained on  \ndeputation.  No monetary benefit in respect of his proforma promotion in the parent \noffice shall be allowed to him while he is on deputation.  Proforma promotion in such \ncases should be made with effect from a date determined in accordance with the ‗next \nbelow rule and not from any earlier date.  \n[Authority: – Finance Division ‘s O.M. No. F.1.(5) -RI-(R.W.P.)/62, dated 21 -4-1962].  \n 9.3 Proforma Promotions –  \nReview of Cases  \n The question has been raised whether the instructions issued in the \nEstablishment Division O ffice Memorandum  No. 1/28/71 -D. II, dated 29th  July, 1971 \nregarding proforma promotion apply also to past cases where proforma promotions had \nalready been made prior to the issue of these instructions. The Ministries and Divisions \n                                                           \n Or the successor organization i.e. E.C.O.  \nPage - 698                             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                CHAPTER -7                   \n \n are advised to  review all such cases.  If the officer had been allowed to proceed on \ndeputation for a specific period, he should be requested to revert to the parent department \non expiry of that period. In case no period was specified, the parent department should \nexami ne the propriety of re -calling the officer to the parent cadre as it is not \nadministratively desirable that officers and staff should remain away from their parent \ncadre for unduly long period, say more than 3 years in the case of gazetted officers and 5 \nyears in the case of non -gazetted staff. However, if in the case of a particular department \nthe number involved is large, the recall of the deputationist should be judiciously \nstaggered so that no large scale reversions are caused in the parent office conse quent on \nthe re -call of the deputationists. Priority in re -call should be given to those who have been \nallowed proforma promotion in the parent cadre. Where, however, the borrowing \ndepartments are prepared to confirm such officers and staff on their own es tablishment \n(provided this is admissible in accordance with the recruitment rules applicable to the post) \nand the officer or staff is also willing to be so absorbed, reversion to parent cadre may not be \ninsisted upon.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Division ‘s O.M.No.1(28)/71 -D.II, dated 28 -3-1972].  \n 9.4 Reversion of Deputationists to Parent Departments  \n Cases have come to the notice of the Establishment Division where officers \nwhose services were obtained on deputation for a specific period were not returned by  the \nborrowing department when the parent department asked for their reversion.  Attention in \nthis regard is invited to the Establishment Division ‘s O.M.No.1(28)/ 71 -D.II, dated the \n28th March, 1972, wherein it was laid down that officers obtained on deput ation should be \nreverted to their parent department on the expiry of the period of deputation.  It was \nfurther laid down therein that the period of deputation should normally be 3 years in the \ncase of officers in BPS 16 and above 5 years in the case of sta ff in BPS 15 and below.  \n 2. In the interest of efficient administration, it is reiterated that the above \nmentioned instructions should be followed rigidly and the deputationists reverted to their \nparent department on the expiry of the period of deputation unless the intention is to \npermanently absorb the deputationist in the cadre or department where he is serving on \ndeputation and the recruitment rules for the post provide for such a course.  In such cases, \nthe consent of the deputationist to the suspensio n or termination of lien on his permanent \npost in the parent department, as well as the agreement of the parent department, should \nbe obtained. With the completion of these formalities the deputationist will be treated as \nregular member of the establishmen t of the borrowing department.  \n 3. Where, however, it is not intended to permanently absorb the deputationist \nin the borrowing department the deputationist must not be allowed to remain away from \nhis parent cadre for unduly protected period; he should be r everted to the parent \ndepartment on expiry of the period of deputation as originally fixed.  If the borrowing \ndepartment needs the services of another officer having the qualifications or experience \npossessed by the deputationist, a request should be made to the lending department to \ndepute some other officer in his place possessing the same qualifications or experience as \nfar as possible.  The borrowing department in no case should insist on retaining a \nparticular individual beyond the original period of d eputation.  \n  CHAPTER -7                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021 )                               Page - 699 \n \n  4.

The matter has been considered in the Estab lishment Division in light of the \nprovisions of the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rules, 1973, read \nwith the Promotion Policy covering promotion upto BPS 21. It is clarified that an officer \nrecommended for promotion on temporary basi s by the Central Selection \nBoard/Departmental Promotion Committee and approved by the competent authority is \nliable to reversion to lower post in case the higher post is subsequently either abolished or \nceases to exist or its original incumbent joins back.  However, if a temporarily promoted \nofficer continues working against the higher post without any break and, in the \nmeanwhile, a regular vacancy in the cadre becomes available, no fresh clearance of the \nCentral Selection Board/DPC and approval of the compe tent authority is required for his \npromotion to higher post on regular basis. The officer will, therefore, be deemed to have \nbeen promoted on regular basis with effect from the date of occurrence of the vacancy on \nregular basis in the cadre, subject to the  following conditions: - \n(a) No disciplinary/criminal proceedings have been initiated against him/her \nduring the period from the date of temporary promotion till the occurrence of \nvacancy on regular basis.  \n(b) His/her up -to-date service record would form th e basis for assessing fitness \nfor promotion on regular basis i.e. quantified score should not be less than \nminimum threshold prescribed for the purpose.  \n[Authority: – Estt. Div. ‘s O.M.No.30/2/90 -CP-3, dated 18 -2-1997].  \nCLARIFICATION  \n Refer to Establishment Division ‘s O.M. No.30/2/90 -CP-3 dated 18 -02-1997 \nwhich inter alia provided for regularizing the promotion of officers who were earlier \npromoted against deputation, leave etc vacancies on the ground that regular vacancy has \noccurred subject to satisfaction of the conditions prescribed under the above referred O.M. A \nnumber of references are received in the Establishment Division regarding clarification for \n  CHAPTER -7                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021 )                               Page - 703 \n \n extending the applic ability of this O.M. to the cases of initial appointments made against \ntemporary vacancies.  \n 2. The matter was considered in the Establishment Division and it has been \ndecided to extend the applicability of instructions contained in the above referred O.M.  dated \n18-02-1997 to cases of initial appointment as well subject to the following conditions: — \n(i) The initial appointment against the temporary vacancy is made in the manner \nprescribed for appointment against regular vacancy duly observing \nregional/provincial quota and qualification & experience prescribed in the \nRecruitment Rules of the post concerned .  \n(ii) The incumbent has continuously worked on the temporary vacancy during \nthe period from appointment to the occurrence of the regular vacancy.  \n(iii) No disciplinary/criminal proceedings have been initiated against him/her \nduring the said period.  \n(iv) His/her up -to-date service record would form the basis for assessing fitness \nfor the continuation of subject appointment.  \n[Authority: - Establishment Division ‘s O.M No.30/2/90 -CP-3/R-2 dated 14 -04-2014].  \n 9.7 Promotion of an Officer/  \nOfficial During LPR  \n A question has arisen whether an officer/official who is on LPR can be \nconsidered for promotion against a higher post or otherwise.  \n 2.  The matter has been considered and the view held is that LPR is one of the \ntypes of leave to which a government servant is entitled. A s he continues to be a \ngovernment servant and can be called even for duty, he can, therefore, be considered for \npromotion against a higher post during LPR.  \n 3.  All Ministries/Divisions are requested to bring these instructions  to the notice \nof all concern ed. \n[Authority: – Estt.

It has been observed \nthat the said instructions are not being complied with, therefore, it becomes difficult to \nmonitor an officer ‘s health  for the purpose of posting, training and retention in service. \nBesides, several cases have been observed where officers nominated for mandatory training \nfell seriously ill during training and had to be sent back without completing the training.  \n 2. It is,  therefore, advised that the instructions referred in pre -para may be \ncomplied with and Annual Medical Examination of every officer be ensured. As the Annual \nMedical Examination Reports are to be placed in the C.R. dossiers, copy of the Reports \nmay be forw arded to the authorities responsible for maintaining C.R. dossiers.  \n 3. Apropos to above, it has been decided that the latest Medical Report shall \nhenceforth be a compulsory requirement at the time of nomination of officers for \nmandatory training i.e. MCMC ,SMC and NMC/NDU. While sending nomination of \nofficers for mandatory training, their latest Annual Medical Examination Report may also \nbe furnished to the Establishment Division. However, the said requirement shall be \napplicable w.e.f. 1st January,2014.  \n 4. The Ministries/Divisions are requested to bring the aforesaid decision of the \nCompetent Authority to the notice of all concerned including Attached Departments/Sub -\nordinate Offices under their administrative control for information and compliance.  \n [Authority: — Estt.

At the higher level, selection is made by the \nPublic Service Commissions.  Separate criteria are prescribed for indu ction at each \nlevel.  In all these systems and procedures, one thing must be common, that is, \nassessment of the candidate ‘s knowledge of Islamic  and Pakistan Studies.  Persons \nwithout adequate knowledge of these subjects will not be considered fit for \nappo intment to government jobs, irrespective of their proficiency in other fields. \nNecessary instructions will be issued; as executive orders, immediately, and \nimplementation by all concerned ensured.

The matter has been examined in the Establishment Division and it has been \ndecided that the existing rules give the Chairman, FPSC an d the Departmental Selection \nCommittees adequate powers to prescribe the qualifications for inducting individuals in \ngovernment departments. There is, therefore, no need for any change in the rules.  \n 3. All selection authorities, however, will ensure that a certain percentage of the \nmarks in any interview/examination carried out for induction of individuals into the \ngovernment service will be reserved for Islamic and Pakistan Studies. Persons scoring less \nthan pass marks in these subjects will not be consid ered fit for appointment to government \njobs, irrespective of their proficiency in other fields.  \n [Authority: – Estt.

No. 1/21/76 -D. II, \ndated the 18th September, 1976 ( Annex ) that if a senior person declines promotion to suit his \nconvenience, he should lose in seniority to the next junior person who is promoted in the \nrelev ant vacancy, and that he should not be considered for promotion till after his case for \npromotion has been considered again by the Selection Board in a subsequent meeting. The \ncompetent authority may also consider the grounds on which promotion has been de clined \nand, in suitable cases, may take disciplinary action (on grounds of misconduct, that is, refusal \nto obey orders to proceed on transfer to another station) where it is clear that the promotion \nhas been declined to evade transfer to an unattractive st ation, and may impose the penalty of \nwithholding of promotion for a specified period.  \n 2. It has now been considered that the aforesaid decision is inconsistent with \nthe broad provisions of the Civil Servants Act, 1973.  The Establishment Division  \n O.M. No. 1/21/76 -D.II, dated 18th September, 1976 is, therefore, withdrawn with immediate \neffect.  All such cases where senior persons decline promotion to suit their convenience shall \nbe decided in future on merits of each case in consultation with Establishme nt Division.  \n[Authority: – Estt.

No. 1/21/76 -D.II, dated the 18th September, 1976].  \n The question as to how the seniority of a person who is cleared for promotion  but \nwho declines promotion should be determined when he is subsequently promoted has been \nconsidered. It has been decided that if a senior person declines promotion to suit his \nconvenience, he should lose in seniority to the next junior person who is prom oted in the \nrelevant vacancy, and that he should not be considered for promotion till after his case for \npromotion has been considered again by the Selection Board in a subsequent meeting. The \ncompetent authority may also consider the grounds on which prom otion has been declined \nand, in suitable cases, may take disciplinary action (on grounds of misconduct that is, refusal \nto obey orders to proceed on transfer to another station) where it is clear that the promotion \nhas been declined to evade transfer to an  unattractive station, and may impose the penalty of \nwithholding of promotion for a specified period.  \nPage - 734                             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                CHAPTER -7                   \n \n Sl.No.15  \nDiscontinuation of use of the Term ―Competent Authority ‖  \n The Prime Minister has directed that the words ―competent authority ‖ frequently \nused in official notifications and correspondence should be discontinued with immediate \neffect.

A question \nhas arisen as to whether the term ―Central Government ‖ for the purpose of these Rules \nmeans the *Central Government in the Establishment Division or the *Central Govern -\nment in each administrative Ministry/Division.  \n 2. The matter has  been considered in consultation with the Law Division and \nit has been held that the term ―Government ‖ appearing in the Government Servants \n(Conduct) Rules, 1964 means the *Central Government in any Ministry/Division. This \nmeans that ordinarily an officer in each administrative Ministry/Division is to be granted \npermission under any rule of the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964 from that \nMinistry/ Division.  \n 3.  Ministries/Divisions are therefore advised: - \n(a) to dispose of individual cases under th e Government Servants (Conduct) \nRules, 1964 in the light of the above interpretation instead of referring \nsuch cases to the Estt.  Division.  \n(b) to consider internal delegation of powers below the rank of Secretaries/  \nActing Secretaries so that cases may be  decided at appropriate level and all \ncases are not referred to the Secretary of a Ministry/ Division.  \n 4. Cases involving interpretation of the Conduct Rules will, however, \ncontinue to be referred to the Establishment Division for advice.  \n 5.  Cases of of ficers belonging to an All -Pakistan Service who are serving, for \nthe time being, in a province, should be decided by the Chief Secretary of the Province \nconcerned. Provincial Governments may also like to consider further delegation of \npowers so that cases can be decided at appropriate level and every case is not referred to \nthe Chief Secretary.  \n 6.

It has been found that this rule is not being observed by government servants and a \nnumber of cases have recently come to notice in which government servants have \naccepted, particularly on occasions of marriage, expensive gifts from p ersons with whom \nthey have or are likely to have official dealings. It has also been observed that government \nofficials demand expensive dowries at the time of marriage and even display such dowries \nand gifts before large gatherings.  The Committee on the Eradication of Social Evils has \ndeplored the practice of demanding and displaying dowries and gifts on occasions of \nmarriage as it encourages lavish expenditure and ostentatious living . \n 2. In view of the increasing tendency to demand and display dowries a nd to \naccept expensive gifts, government have decided that rule 5 (1) of the Government \nServants (Conduct) Rules , 1964  should be enforced more rigorously and government \nservants should be directed to avoid lavish expenditure on marriage and other ceremonie s \nPage - 758            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                            CHAPTER -8       \n        \n and to desist from demanding or displaying dowries or accepting gifts from persons other \nthan those who are closely related to them.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

Government view such malpractices with extreme \ndispleasure and wish to re -emphasize the necessity of stopping forthwith such practices, \nwherever they exist and in whatever fo rm or shape.  \n 2.  In this connection , attention of the Ministries/Divisions is invited to clause (1) \nof rule 5 of the Government Servants (Conduct ) Rules , 1964  which provides, inter alia , that a \ngovernment servant shall not, except with the previous sancti on of the government, accept, or \npermit any member of his family to accept, from any person any gift the receipt of which will \nplace him under any form of official obligation to the donor. [If, however, due to very \nexceptional reas ons, a gift cannot be refused, the same may, under intimation to the Cabinet \nDivision , be kept for official use in the department or organization  in which he is working].  \n 3.

Beside s being unbecoming of a \ngovernment servant, acceptance of such offers tends to place him under official obligation \nto the party concerned which is not conducive to good administration. It ha s, therefore, \nbeen decided that g overnment servants should attempt  to avoid acceptance of offers of \nsuch trips.

Invariably the excuse for having accepted awards by government \nservants in ignorance of the rules.  \n 2. The competent authority has taken serious notice of this tendency and has \nbeen pleased to  direct that all Ministries/ Divisions/Departments may be asked to \ndisseminate the rule position to government servants for strict compliance. The \nMinistries/Divisions are requested to please bring the rule position as defined in Section 6 \nof the Governmen t Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964 and Article 259 (1) of the \nConstitution of Pakistan, to the notice of all employees working under them and also to \nthe employees of autonomous statutory bodies under their administrative control.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

Under \nsub-rule 2(c) of the same rule, no government servant shall solicit any subscriptions in aid of \na fund raised for non -official purposes. Instructions in amplification of this rule issued in  the \nEstablishment Division O. M. No. 4/39/61 -EVI, dated  the 26th July  1961  enjoin   that   \nsubscriptions  which  tend  to  glorify  a  particular  government official should be discoura -\nged. In view of this, the conduct of government servants who encour age non -officials to give \nbig farewell parties on the occasion of their transfers, or who take interest in promoting a \nlarge number of pointless functions and inauguration ceremonies would attract the \nprovisions of rule 3 of the Government Servants (Conduc t) Rules ,1964. \n 2. It is, therefore, requested that the Ministries/Divisions/Provincial Governm -\nents may kindly bring the above rule and instructions to the notice of all government servants  \nand put a stop to this tendency among them.  It may also be empha sized that breach of this \nrule will make them liable to be proceeded against under the Government Servants \n(Efficiency and Discipline) Rules , 1973 . \n[Authority. - Estt.

A question has be en raised whether cases of government servants who are \ninvited as chief guests would come within the mischief of this rule.  \n 3. The main object of this rule is to discourage government servants from \naccepting invitation to parties where they will be chief guests. In cases where acceptance \nof such invitations are considered to be unavoidable, the official concerned should take \npermission from the next higher authority.  When the government servant concerned is the \nHead of the Department or Secretary to the Government , he will obtain permission \nthrough the Secretary of the Ministry concerned or the Establishment Secretary as the \ncase may be.   \n [Authority. - Estt.

This \nwould not apply naturally to the Basic Democracies *. \n 2.  A question has,  however, arisen as to what criteria should be fixed for the \nguidance of the next higher authority in considering cases for such permission. The next \nhigher authorities should naturally exercise their discretion in this regard keeping in view \nthe basic obj ectives of the order which is meant to put a check on indiscriminate raising of  \nsubscriptions for purposes which are not necessary from the point of view of the \ncommunity as a whole.

Such \npersons may be employed there or may be carrying on some independent \nbusiness or profession;  \n (b) Government servants who are Pakistani nationals employed in our \nEmbassies/Missions abroad;  \n (c) Pakistani nationals employed in branches or subsidiaries abroad of \nPakistani companies/firms.  \n 2. There is no objection to Pakistani nationals who have settled down abroad \nacquiring immovable property or foreign share s and securities by resorting to bank \nborrowings from their own resources provided no exchange liability is created for \nremittance from Pakistan at any stage.  If and when such persons return to Pakistan, they \nwill have to transfer the income and the sales -proceeds of such properties to Pakistan as \nrequired in terms of the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947.  \nThere would also be no objection if the branches of Pakistani banks operating abroad give \nloans and advances to Pakistani settle rs abroad for the purpose of acquiring properties abroad \nprovided these advances and interest thereon are recovered entirely in foreign exchange and no \nexchange liability is created for remittance from Pakistan as stated above.  \n 3.  As regards government s ervants who are Pakistani nationals employed in \nthe Embassies/Missions abroad or other government servants posted on duty or training \nabroad, they should be discouraged from acquiring properties or foreign shares and \nsecurities abroad. The remuneration which such persons receive is intended to cover their \nliving and other incidental expenses. If an official can manage to save funds out of his \nremuneration , such savings should be remitted to Pakistan rather than used for acquiring \nproperties and foreign shar es and securities abroad.  \n 4.  Some Pakistani banks, companies and firms have been permitted to \nestablish branch offices or subsidiaries abroad.  In some cases , Pakistani nationals have been \nemployed in such branch offices or subsidiaries abroad.  They sho uld also , like government \nservants , transfer their savings, if any, to Pakistan instead of acquiring assets abroad.  \n [Authority .- Finance Division ‘s O.M.No.1(14) -EF/EXP/62, dated 19 -8-1963].  \n \n                         \nAlso refer to State Bank of Pakistan -Foreign Exchange Manual as updated upto March,2017.  \nCHAPTER -8           ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                 Page - 765 \n \n 4.4 Declaration of Assets Held and Acquired by  \nGovernment  Serva nts and Corporation Employees  \n Instructions regarding Declaration of Property and Assets have been issued from \ntime to time, but unfortunately these have been either insufficiently understood or dealt \nwith in routine.

Since during performance of official duties such \ngovernment servants come across other government servants and private parties, they \nmanage to obtain  insurance policies from them by taking undue advantage of their official \nposition. This state of affairs not only brings disrepute to the departments to which they \nbelong, but also distracts their attention from official duties and retards their efficienc y. \n 2. According to rule 16 of the Government Servants (Conduct)  Rules, 1964, no \ngovernment servant can engage himself in any trade or business, directly or indirectly, \nwithout the previous sanction of the government. Such transactions, therefore, constitu te a \nviolation of that rule and render the government servants concerned liable to disciplinary \naction under the Government Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules.  \n 3. Ministries/Divisions are advised that it should generally be made known to \nall concer ned that government view this situation with concern and desire that government \nservants who indulge in this business indirectly through their family members should \nabandon it forthwith.  \n[Authority .— Estt. Div. ‘s O.M.No.3/9/66 -D.II, dated 15 -8-1966].  \n 6.3 Private Work During and After Office Hours  \n It has been brought to the notice of the Prime Minister that in order to supplement \ntheir income, a large number of low paid government servants  do private work in addition to \ntheir government jobs.  Some of them  work as ushers in the afternoon, evening and night \nshows of cinemas while others are often absent from their jobs under government as they \nattend to private work even during office hours.  \n 2. Government work inevitably suffers on account of these governme nt servants \nperforming private jobs during or outside office hours. It also aggravates the unemployment \nproblem. The Prime Minister has, therefore, been pleased to direct that action should be \ntaken to put a stop to this objectionable trend among governmen t servants.  \n[Authority. — Estt. Div. ‘s O.M. No.1/20/76 -D-IV, dated 6 -3-1976].  \n 6.4 Future Good Conduct of Pensioners  \n Attention is invited to clause (1) of Article 351 of the Civil Service Regu lations \nwhich reads as follows: — \n ―Future good conduct is an im plied condition of every grant of a pension. The \nLocal Government and the Government of Pakistan reserve to themselves the \nright of withholding or withdrawing a pension or any part  of it, if the \n                         \n Now Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules,2020.  \nPage - 778             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -8     \n           \n pensioner be convicted of serious crime or be guilty of grave  misconduct. ‖ \n 2.  It has been decided that the provision of the above Article should be strictly \nenforced in all cases by the pension sanctioning authorities. In cases where a pensioner \ncommits misconduct, prompt action should be taken to withhold or with draw his pension or \nany part of it.  \n 3.  Misconduct in such cases would mean conduct prejudicial to good behaviour \nor unbecoming of a gentleman. The decision of the President on any question whether any \nact on the part of the pensioner is misconduct or not  shall be final and binding.  \n[Authority. - Establishment Secretary ‘s D.O. letter No.5/4/73 -D, IV, dated 11 -8-1973].  \n 6.5 Taking Part in Politics by Pensioners  \n Attention is invited to clause (2) of Article 351 of the Civil Service Regulations \nwhich reads a s follows :— \n ―(2) Except with the previous sanction of the Central Government, no pensioner \nshall, within a period of two years from the date of his/her retirement, take \npart in any election or engage in political activity of any kind. ‖ \n 2.  It would be n oticed from the above that the pensioner can participate in \npolitical activity within two years of his retirement from service only with the previous \nsanction of the Federal Government. It has, however, been decided that as a matter of policy \nno permission  should in future be granted to any pensioner to engage in political activity of \nany kind.  \n 3.  It may be clarified that political activit y would include activities like \naffiliation with political parties, public speeches, writing articles, giving statemen ts, \nattending political meetings, making monetary contribution for political purposes etc. This \nclarification may be brought to the notice of the government servants and also to pensioners \nwho have not yet completed two years from the date of their retirem ent. \n[Authority. - Establishment Secretary ‘s  D.O. letter No. 5/3/73 -D.IV, dated 31 -7-1973].  \n 7.1 Employment of Dependent Family Members of a \nGovernment Servant in Foreign Missions in  Pakistan  \n A question has arisen whether dependent family members of a government servant \ncan seek employment in foreign mission s in Pakistan. The matter has been considered and it \nhas been decided that government servants should not allow their wives to seek employment \nin foreign  diplomatic missions in Pakistan.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

There is, however, no bar to the \nspouses of government servants taking employment or engaging in any trade or profession.  It \nhas come to the notice of  government that the wives of some government servants have been \nengaging in trade and business where influence of the husband could possible be misused.  In \nsuch cases, the possibility of public interest being jeopardized cannot be ruled out.  \n 2. In order  to safeguard the public interest in such cases, it has been decided \nthat all government officials whose spouses have under -taken some private job or are \nengaged in business and trade may be directed to render a certificate to the Secretary of the \nMinistry /Division or the Head of the Department concerned that the profession, trade or \nbusiness in which his or her spouse is engaged is in no way under his/her official influence.  \n[Authority. -Estt.

Under Rule 16 of the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964, \ngovernment servants are not allowed to engage in private business, trade, or employment/  \nconsultancy work., except with the previous sanctions of the government, and provide \nsuch activity does not amount to conflict of interest in terms of the officer ‘s position or \nobligations as a government servant. Further, a government servant shall not undertake or \nshall discontinue such work, if so directed by the Government. Also, a gover nment \nservant who has any doubt about the propriety of undertaking any particular work should \nrefer the matter for orders of the Government.  \n 3.  The above provisions of the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules,1964 \nneed to be complied with in letter and s pirit. These may therefore be circulated to all \ngovernment servants belonging to all occupational cadres falling under the Federal \nGovernment jurisdiction. Any violation of these instructions tantamounts to misconduct \nand is liable to be proceeded against under the Government Servants (Efficiency and \nDiscipline) Rules,1973.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

Under the Rules ibid, no government servant can participate in any media \nplatform except with the express permission of the Government. Rule 18 of the Rules ibid \nbars a government servant from sharing official information or document with a \ngovernment servant unauthorized  to receive it or a private person or press. Further, Rule \n22 of the Rules ibid refrains a government servant from making any statement of fact or \nopinion which is capable of embarrassing the Government in any document published or \nin any communication mad e to the press or in any public utterance or television \nprogramme or radio broadcast delivered by him or her. Furthermore, Rules 21, 25, 25 -A \nand 25 -B of the Rules ibid bar a government servant from expressing views against \nideology and integrity of Pakist an or any government policy or decision. Besides, they \nalso bar a government servant from offering views on any media platform which may \neither harm the national security or friendly relations with foreign states; or offend public \norder, decency or moralit y; or amount to contempt of court or defamation or incitement to \nan offence; or, propagate sectarian creeds.  \n 3. Despite the aforementioned instructions and the guiding legal frame -work, it \nhas been observed that government servants often engage themselves  with social media \ni.e. websites and applications that enable users to create and share contents or participate \nin social networking /virtual communities/online groups. They, while using different \nsocial media  platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Whats App, Instagram, Microblog -\nging etc. to air their views on a host of subject, sometimes indulge in actions or behavior \nthat does not conform to the required standards of official conduct, as envisaged in the \nRules ibid. Such actions range from unauthorized re laying of the official information to \ndisseminating the wrong or misleading information to airing of political or secretarian \nviews etc. \n 4. In view of the foregoing, it is expedient to issue the following instructions \nfor governing use of social media pla tforms by government servants: - \ni. The same instructions as are applicable to government servants while \nspeaking at public fora or publishing articles in print media, shall apply, \nmutatis mutandis , to the use of social media by them.  \nii. As provided in Rul e 18 of the Rules ibid, they shall not indulge in \nCHAPTER -8            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 781 \n \n unauthorized disclosure of the official information or sharing of the \nofficial documents they come across during the course of performing their \nduties, via social media.  \niii. In order to maintain their impa rtiality and objectivity in performance, they \nshall not partake in any discussion on social media or exchange or forward \ninformation or message that express their opinion on political issues.  \niv. They shall not participate in furthering of any information especially \npertaining to government matters that, prima facie, appears to be \nunauthentic and misleading.  \nv. They shall not make any disparaging remarks aimed at any individual or \ngroup or sect or faith and shall uphold values guiding the Civil Service at \nall times. They are advised to observe discretion and moderation in use of \nthe Social Media and uphold high standards of propriety.  \n5. It is, however, clarified that the instructions contained at para 4 are not \nintended to discourage any constructive and po sitive use of social media by a government \norganization for engaging with the public to solicit feedback on a government policy, \nsuggestions for improvement in service delivery and resolution of their complaints.  \nHowever, such an organization shall edit t heir social media  platforms continuously or \nfrequently to re move offensive, inappropriate and objectionable remarks.  \n6. All government servants are required to comply with the above \ninstructions in letter and spirit. These may, therefore, be circulated to  all government \nservants belonging to all the occupational cadres falling in the jurisdiction of the Federal \nGovernment. Violation of one or more of these instructions will tantamount to misconduct \nand shall invite disciplinary action against the delinquen t government servant under Civil \nServants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2020. Further, in case of a violation \ncommitted on a group platform the ‗Administrators ‘‘ or the ‗Admin ‘, if they are serving \ngovernment servants, shall also be liable to the disc iplinary proceedings.  \n7. All Federal Secretaries/Additional Secretaries (Incharge)/Service or Cadre \nAdministrators/Chief Secretaries are requested to ensure implementation of these instructions.  \n[Authority: —Establishment Division ‘s O.M No. 14/04/2021 -D-II dated 25 -08-2021.]  \n \n \nPage - 782             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -8     \n           \n  7.5 Membership of Private Associations  \nConnec ted with Social Work  \n It has been brought to the notice of the Establishment Division that permission was \nrefused to a government servant to become an office -holder of a private associatio n, whose \nactivities are confined to social work only and whose character is non-political , on the \nground that membership of such associations is barred to government servants.

However, the \nMinistry of National Reconstruction and Information are requested to kindly clarify the \nabove points for guidance.  \n 12.1 Taking Part in Politics - Bar against  \nSupporting Student Agitations  \n Attention is invited to rule 23 of the Government Servants Conduct Rules, \naccording to which a government servant shall not permit any person dependent on him or \nunder his care or control, to take part in, or in any way assist any movement or activity \nwhich is , or tends directly or indirectly to be subversive of government as by law \nestablished in Pakistan. Under the same rule, a government servant shall be deemed to \nhave permitted a person to take part in, or assisted a movement or activity, if he has not \ntaken ev ery possible precaution, and done everything in his power to prevent such person \nso acting.  In view of this, the conduct of government servants who may , consciously or \nunconsciously , support the student agitators and have sympathies with them would attrac t \nthe provision of rule 23 ** of the Government Servants Conduct Rules.  \n 2.

The recognition of an \nassociation which disregards the rules and adopts other meth ods of representation is apt to \nbe withdrawn.  \n 2. Instances have come to the notice of Establishment Division where \nrecognized associations have addressed their representations to authorities, other than \nthose to whom such representations should have been addressed and have circulated \ncopies of the representations to various authorities. This is a violation of the condition of \nrecognition of associations.  \n 3. In so far as association s recognized by the Establishment Division are \nconcerned, Deputy Secretary,  Establishment Division was designated as the officer to \nwhom representations should be addressed. Other Ministries and Divisions were \nrequested to similarly designate their officers for the purpose. The matter has been further \nexamined and it has been dec ided that more senior officers should be designated for the \npurpose which should not be lower than Joint Secretary in the case of \nMinistries/Divisions and the Head of Department, or his Deputy, in the case of Attached \nand Subordinate Offices.  \n 4.  The Mini stries/Divisions are requested to designate appropriate officers \nfor the purpose of receiving representations and to notify the same to the associations \nwhose recognition is still valid in terms of Establishment Division D.O. letter No. \n16/17/73 -F.I., date d the 30th January, 1974.

In ord er to prevent a repetition of such \ncases, it is considered necessary that no officer should make such approaches in future \nwithout the prior approval of the government under which he is employed or make any \ncommitment, whatsoever, without obtaining the pri or permission of government.  \n[Authority. - Cabinet Division ‘s D.O.  letter No.  54(38) -53-Cord, dated 25 and 26 -8-1953].  \n 17.1 Correspondence with Foreign Missions  \n Instances have come to notice in which foreign missions have offered \nscholarships/ fellowships  to officers employed under the Government of Pakistan and the \nProvincial Governments direct for purposes of their training abroad. Such offers were \naccepted by officers and Ministries/Governments when approached subsequently, \nconcurred in the arrangements . \n 2.  As the Ministry of Finance, etc., are aware , the channel of communication \nbetween the *Central and Provincial Governments and the foreign missions in Pakistan is \nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs except in such cases where certain Ministries/Departmen ts \nhave been allowed to correspond direct with foreign missions on purely routine or \ntechnical matters not involving any question of policy. The Economic Affairs Division \nhave been authorized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to carry on correspondence di rect \nwith the foreign missions in matters relating to the technical assistance schemes. All \nMinistries/Divisions are, therefore, requested to route their correspondence with foreign \nmissions on this subject through that Division.  \n 3. In view of the above, the Ministry of Finance, etc., are requested to issue \ninstructions that no officer working under them should correspond with foreign missions \nin Pakistan direct and that no offer of fellowship/scholarship received from any foreign \nmission or any foreign government otherwise than through the Economic Affairs Division \nshould be accepted by them nor should any Ministry concur in the acceptance of such an \noffer except with the concurrence of the Economic Affairs Division.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

Under the existing detailed instructions, all Secretaries to the Federal \nGovernment and Chief Secretaries of Provincial Governm ents are required to ensure that \nunder no circumstances should any scholarships or invitations for visits abroad be \naccepted from foreign missions/ governments when these are offered directly to \nindividuals. Any direct offer is required to be politely decli ned with the suggestion that \nthe offer be made through the Foreign Office. In the event of direct invitation/offer being \nreceived by any individual or official from a foreign government through the post, it has \nto be transmitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for processing.  \n 3.  These procedures have been laid down in accordance with the \nwell-established international rules in diplomatic theory and practice governing the \nconduct of a sending state and its representatives in a receiving state. Extension  of invitations \nby a sending state to the citizens of the receiving state and their acceptance by the latter fall \nwithin the purview of Article 41 (para 2) of the  Vienna Convention, as follows: — \n ―All official business with the receiving state entrusted to  the Mission by \nthe sending state shall be conducted with or through the Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs of the receiving state or such other Ministry as may be agreed. ‖ \n 4.  It is noted with regret, however , that contrary to the laid -down instructions, \nthere have been several instances where direct invitations were extended by certain \nforeign governments/missions to Pakistan nationals to visit their countries or to \nparticipate in conferences and seminars there. Certain foreign missions in Pakistan have \nalso be en seeking to establish direct contacts with various local bodies, institutions and \nopposition elements.  \n 5.  Pursuant to a recent decision taken by the Federal Cabinet, it is reit erated \nonce again that the laid -down procedure for contacts with foreign diplomatic missions, \nacceptance of invitations, gifts and scholarships etc., from foreign government s should be \nstrictly enforced without any exception. In the case of private individuals and politicians \nreceiving direct invitations, the State Bank of Pakista n and other agencies concerned \nshould adopt effective measures to stop their departure fro m the country on un -\nauthoriz edly-sponsored visits abroad. The system of prior clearance from the Interior \nDivision and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be stric tly followed in such cases.  \n[Authority .— Paras 2 -5 of Estt .

Such acts, \nobviously are a clear violation of rule 30 of the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964  \nand instructions is sued thereunder.  \n 2. The government has taken a serious view of the above tendency amongst \ngovernment servants and it has, therefore, become imperative to circulate the government \ninstructions on the subject once again for strict compliance by the gov ernme nt servants: — \n (1) Government servants should exercise great caution and restraint in the matter \nof social contacts with the members of foreign mission in Pakistan and , inter-\nalia, abstain from extending invitations to them for private lunches/dinners at \ntheir residence etc. \n (2) Officials of the level of Deputy Secretary and below should not receive the \nofficials of the foreign missions, except with the express permission of the \nSecretary.  \n (3) Government servants are also prohibited from contacting, or ma king direct \napproaches, to the foreign missions in Pakistan, in connection with their \nprivate business. All such approaches should be made through proper \nchannel ( i.e. the Ministry of Foreign Affairs).  \n (4) Invitations extended by the foreign missions on t he occasions of their \nnational days to the officers below the status of Joint Secretaries, may be \naccepted only after obtaining permission from the Secretary.  \n (5) The participation of officers below the status of Joint Secretary in the private \nfunctions, arranged by the foreign diplomats, should generally be \ndiscouraged.

It has been \nclarified that if a person is dismissed or removed from service or compulsorily retired , he does \nnot retain the sta tus of a civil servant for the purpose of any other disciplinary proceedings or \nimposition of any other penalty. There is a concept of law that the process of appeal is the \ncontinuation of the original proceedings, therefore, if a dismissed, removed or ret ired employee \nmoves a departmental appeal or representation or files an appeal before the appropriate judicial \nforum he is deemed to be a civil servant for that particular matter only under the said concept of \ncontinuation of status during the process of a ppeal.  \n 2. Where an appeal is filed, the appellant may be treated as a civil servant for \nthe purpose of disposal of that appeal only and the result of any other inquiry that may \nhave been conducted may be held in abeyance. However, if the dismissed, remove d or \nretired person does not fil e any appeal, the order of dismissal, removal from service or \ncompulsory retirement will attain finality and the result of the other inquiry will become \ninfructuous.  \n[Authority : Estt.

It is clarified that it is not appropriate to appoint an ―Inquiry Officer ‖ \njunior to the officer being proceeded against under the aforementioned rules as that could \nlead to administrative and legal complications at a later stage.

In this connection attention is invited to the \nprovisions of Fundamental Rule 29 which stipulates that ― if a Government Servant on \naccount of misconduct or inefficiency is reduced  to a lower grade or post or to a lower \nstage in his time scale, the authority ordering such  reduction shall state the period for \nwhich it shall be effective and whether on restoration it shall operate to postpone future \nincrements and if so to what exte nt‖. Law Division have advised that the provisions of \nFR-29 should be treated as supplementary to *[rule 4 ( c) of the Government Servants \n(Efficiency and Discipline) Rules,  2020] . It is, therefore, necessary that while passing an \norder imposing a penalty o f reduction to a lower post or time scale or to a lower stage in a \ntime scale, the requirements prescribed in FR -29 should be strictly observed.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

Both the provisions mentioned at (a) and (b) in the preceding paragraph \nare mandatory. On an appeal filed by a government servant against the  order of his \ncompulsory retirement, the Service Tribunal has recently set aside the order of his \ncompulsory retirement on the grounds that neither the action to be taken was specifically \nmentioned in the Show Cause Notice nor was he given a reasonable opportunity of \n                         \n Modified as Civil Servants (Efficie ncy & Discipline) Rules, 2020 . \n BPS. \nModified in line  with Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2020 . \nCHAPTER -8            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 819 \n \n showing cause against the proposed action. It has been pointed out by the Services  \nTribun al that there are decisions of the superior courts on the point that whenever any \ndiscretion is given to an authority, it has to be exercised not arbitrarily but honestly, \njustly, and fairly in the spirit of rules, and on judicial grounds and for substanti al reasons. \nFor this purpose, the nature of allegations against the accused has to be considered. In a \ncase where it is clear to the [authorized officer ] that the accused can be given reasonable \nopportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken e.g. where the  \nallegations could be decided by reference to record in a summary manner, the procedure \nunder sub -rule (iii) of rule 5(1) may be adopted.  Otherwise, the ends of justice would be \nserved by ordering an inquiry through an Inquiry Offi cer or Inquiry Committee.  \n 3. In a Show Cause Notice, the proposed action is required to be specified, and no \ngeneral mention is to be made by reference to all the minor or major penalties in the rules.  \n 4. Further, serving of a Show Cause Notice and mere reply thereto in denial \nof allegations or mere questions and answers do not amount to affording the accused a \nreasonable opportunity of showing cause as required by [clause (b) of rule 7 (a) to (f) of \nthe Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) R ules, 2020] . The requirement of \nreasonable opportunity of showing cause against proposed action will only be satisfied if \nparticulars of the charge or charges, substance of evidence in support of the charges and \nspecific punishment which would be called fo r after the charge or charges are established are \ncommunicated to the civil servant who is given reasonable time and opportunity to show cause.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

This not only results in \nundue delay in finalization of these disciplinary cases but also undue wastage of \ngovernment money on publication of such notices.  \n                         \nThe role of authorized  Officer  has not been incorporated in Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules,2020.     \nModified as per Rule 7 (a) (b)  of Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2020 .  \nModified as per Rule 7 (c) of Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2020 . \n@Modified as per Rule 11 of Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2020 . \n@@Sl.No. 23. 1 is modified as per Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2020 . \nCHAPTER -8            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 821 \n \n  2.  The matter has, therefore, been considered in the Establishment Division \nin consultation with Law Division. It is clarified that under the Civil  Servants (Efficiency \nand Discipline) Rules, 2020 , there is no provision making it obligatory or mandatory for \nthe authority/ [**] to publish a notice in the newspaper in the cases of unauthori zed \nabsence/  abscondment from duty. The requirement of rule 7 of the Civil  Servants \n(Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2020 , is that the accused may be informed of the action \nproposed to be taken in regard to him and the grounds of such action and that he may be \ngiven a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action. This information can \nbe conveyed to him by different means , i.e. by registered post at his last known address or \nby affixation of a notice at that address, etc.  Same is the positio n under rule 7(b) in \nrespect of service of a charge -sheet. According to rule 13 of the said rules nothing in rule \n7 shall apply if the authority competent to dismiss or remove a person from service, or to \nreduce a person in rank, is satisfied that, for rea sons to be recorded, in writing, by that \nauthority, it is not reasonably practicable to give the accused an opportunity of showing \ncause, for instance, if it is reported that the accused has left his place of abode without \nleaving an address or he has gone  out of the country and his whereabouts are not known. \nIf the authority mentioned in rule 8(b) is satisfied about the genuineness of the report, it \nmay invoke the provision contained in the said rule. The publication of a notice in \nnewspapers may not be re sorted to.  \n 3. The publication of notice in the newspapers, in such cases should, \nhowever, be resorted to in very rare cases where the competent authority is not in a \nposition to record reasons for its satisfaction as to the practicability of affording the  \naccused an opportunity of showing cause. There a lack of response to such a notice may \ninduce that authority to be so satisfied.  \n [Authority .- Estt. Division ‘s O.M.No.4/18/83 -D-2, dated 15 -2-1984].  \n 23.2 [Publication of Charge Sheet or  \nShow  Cause  Notice  in Newspaper ] \n A case has come to notice where long leave granted to a postal clerk was \ncancelled and he was asked to resume duty immediately. When he failed to do so, a notice \nwas published in the newspaper directing him to resume duty within seven days otherwise \nex-parte  proceedings under the *[Civil  Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2020]  \ncould be taken against him which might resu lt in his removal from service.  He failed to \nresume duty. He was accor dingly dismissed from service. His departmen tal appeal was \nrejected. Thereafter, he filed an appeal in the Services Tribunal (Appeal 2(P) of 1984). \nThe Services Tribunal accepted the appeal and set aside the order holding as follows:  \n―It is manifestly evident that the impugned order was passed witho ut \ntaking any proceeding under the Efficiency & Discipline Rules though in \nthe notice published in the newspaper it was categorically stated that in \ncase of failure of the appellant to resume duties, ex-parte  proceedings \n                         \nModified as per Civil Ser vants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2020 . \nPage - 822             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -8     \n           \n under the E& D Ru les would be taken against him.  In any case, the \npunishment of dismissal from service could be awarded only after taking \nproceedings under the E&D Rules which was not done and the impugned \norder was passed in an arbitrary and unlawful manner. The position being \nso clear, the  impugned order cannot be sustained and we have no option \nbut to set it aside. ‖ \n 2. The observations of the Service Tribunal are brought to the noti ce of all \nMinistries, Divisions  and Departments who should ensure that due care is taken in \nobserving the re quirements of *[Civil  Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2020]  \nin taking disciplinary action against civil servants. In this case, what was published was \nmerely a notice or a warning that if the clerk did not resume duty, action under *[Civil  \nServants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2020]  would be taken. However, on his \nfailure to resume duty as directed, order to dismissal was straightway passed without \ninitiating disciplinary action on the ground of misconduct.  \n 3. In this connection, a refere nce is also invited to the Establishment Division \nO.M. No. 4/18/83 -D.2, dated 15th February, 1984, bringing out the requirement of rule \n13, clause (b) and the circumstances in which that rule can be involved. According to rule \n13(b), nothing in rule 7 (containing inquiry procedure) will apply to a case where the \ncompetent authority is satisfied that for reasons to be recorded, in writing, it is not \nreasonably practicable to give the accused an opportunity or showing cause. If all efforts \nto communicate with  the accused through normal channels (like sending him the notice or \ncharge sheet by registered post to his known addresses) fail, that may induce the authority \nto be so satisfied. For this purpose, publication of charge sheet or show cause notice, as \nthe case may be, in the national press is certainly not required. However, if in rare cases, \nthe competent authority is unable to satisfy itself that it is not reasonably practicable to \ncommunicate with the accused, the competent authority may publish the noti ce i.e. show \ncause notice in terms of rule 7(b) of the Civil  Servants (E&D) Rules, 2020  or rule 7(c) or \ncharge sheet in terms of rule 7 (as the case may be) in the newspapers and any lack of \nresponse to it may satisfy the competent authority that it is not  responsibly practicable to \ngive the accused an opportunity of showing cause.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

This is desirable where it is felt that, unless he is \nconfined to a particular station, he might tamper with the evidence likely to be produced against \nhim, but such prohibition s hould not be enforced if there is n o cause for such apprehension.

Cost of stationery and postage stamps \nrequired by him in connection with his defence has, in all cases, to be borne by the accused \ngovernment servant himself.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

It has been decided that though a vacancy \ncaused by suspension of an officer cannot be filled -up substantively, it can be filled up on an \nofficiating basis, and that no supernumerary post need be created in suc h case.  \n 2.

No. 6/2/71 -D.I, dated 20 -9-1971].  \n25.2 Termination of Services of Temporary  \nGovernment Servants under Suspensio n \n Attention is invited to Establishment Division ‘s O.M. Nos. 21/11/61 -D.I, dated \n22nd December, 1962 (Annex -I) and 18th April, 1963 (Annex -II) on the subject of ―Speedy \nDisposal of Disc iplinary Cases -Policy Regarding Government Servants undergoing Crimina l \nProsecuti on before Departmental Action ‖. It is stated that the advice of the Justice Division  \nwas sought whether it was possible to terminate the services of an employee, who was \narrested on a criminal charge of murder and had been undergoing trial for a  long time, \nwithout any notice and without assigning any reasons, in accordance with the terms and \nconditions of his service as contained in his letter of appointment. The position as per advice \nof the Justice Division*, is as follows:  \n 2. A civil servant  is not necessarily in temporary employment merely because \nof a statement in the order of appointment that his appointment will be purely temporary and \nliable to termination at any time without any notice or reasons being assigned. No civil \nservant is a te mporary employee as long as the employment is for an indefinite period or \nagainst a post which continues to exist for an indefinite period. It is extremely difficult to \n                         \n* Law & Justice Division.  \nPage - 824             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -8     \n           \n attribute to the legislature an intention to clothe the authorities concerned with arbi trary \npower of terminating the service of a civil servant in their discretion without assigning any \nreason. The courts have always been reluctant to interpret these provisions in a manner as \nwould justify the externment of an employee without any justifica tion. \n 3. Further after the enactment of Civil Servants Act, 1973, the services of a civil \nservant can either be terminated under section 11 of the Act or under [Civil Servants \n(Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2020 ]. It is not possible to spell out any po wer to terminate \nthe services of an employee without notice and without assigning any reason from the \nprovisions of sub section (3) of section 11 of Civil Servants Act, 1973, especially in the \npresence of the provisions of sub -section (1) thereof regarding  termination of service during \nthe initial or extended period of probation. If an employee has passed through the period of \nprobation to the satisfaction of the competent authority, he is no longer a temporary \nemployee with the meanings of sub section (3) if his employment is for an indefinite period \nor against a post which continues to exist for an indefinite period.  \n 4. In the light of the above advice of the Justice Division, services of an \nemployee can no more be terminated without notice and with assig ning reason [on the basis \nof the contents of Establishment Division ‘s O.M. dated 22nd December 1962 (Annex I)  and \n18th April 1963 (Annex  II) referred to above].  \n[Authority .- Estt. Division ‘s O.M.No.31/64/86 -R3 dated  20 -4-1987].  \n(ANNEX  I) \n[Copy of Establis hment Division O.M. No.12/11/61 -D.I, dated  22nd December, 1962].  \n Instances have come to the notice of the government that there are still a number of \ncases pending in courts against officials for unusually long periods without departmental \nproceedings hav ing been ever resorted to. It has also been found that, in some cases, the \naccused officials have, while continuing under suspension, been absconding for long and \nsometimes for years, presumably with intent to frustrate or delay the court proceedings.  \nWith a view to meeting such situations, it has been decided that, whenever such an instance \ncomes to the notice of the government, the accused official, whether permanent or \ntemporary, should be asked by his last known address to report to his official superi or/court. \nIf he does not comply with the order, government should take up the formalities of his \ndismissal from service on charge of misconduct under the Government Servants \n(Efficiency & Discipline) Rules.[If he turns up and is a temporary hand, his services \nshould be terminated after serving him with the requisite notice or paying him salary in lieu \nthereof, without assigning any reasons for the action].  \n 2.

If in any individual case \nof this nature, the appointing authority considers that irrespective of the outcome of the \ncourt proceedings, the accused official should not be allowed to continue any longer on \nthe pay roll  of the government, such authority may recall the official to duty and terminate \nhis services after serving him with the requisite notice or paying his salary in lieu thereof \nwithout assigning any reasons for the action. [The course of action discussed in  this \nparagraph should be resorted to unless, of course, there is any direction of the court to the \ncontrary in any particular case].  \n 3. It is requested that all Ministries/Divisions, etc., may kindly check up the \nposition of their employees involved in c ourt proceedings and deal with the individual \ncases in the light of the suggestions contained in preceding paragraphs.  \n (ANNEX II)  \n[Copy of Establishment  Division O.M.  No.12/11/61 -D-I date the 18th  April, 1963].  \nReference. - Establishment Division O.M. No.  12/11/61 -D.I, dated the 22nd December, \n1962 (Annex I)  \n A question has arisen as to whether it was necessary to recall a suspended \ntemporary government servant to duty before serving him with the requisite notice of \ndischarge on the ground that his service s were no longer required. The point has been \nfurther examined in Establishment Division in consultation with Law Division and it has \nbeen held that a suspended temporary government servant can be served with service \ntermination notice in accordance with t he terms of the appointment during the period of \nsuspension and discharged after the notice period without requiring him to resume duty.  \n 2. Utmost precaution should, however, be taken to see that no reason is \nassigned for the termination except saying tha t his services are no longer required by the \ngovernment.  \n25.3 Bar Against Mentioning of Unfinalised  \nDepartmental  Proceedings in  \nConfidential Reports  \n It has been noticed that in some annual confidential reports of officers received \nfrom various Ministr ies, a reference is made to departmental proceedings which are still in \nprogress against the officers concerned.  \n 2. The Establishment Division feel that until and unless the result of such \nproceedings has been known and final orders, awarding punishment, if any, have been \npassed by the competent authority, it would not be correct to make any such reference as \n                         \nNote : This applies to temporary employments made on or after 08 -06-1962. \nNow Performance Evaluation Reports.  \nPage - 826             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -8     \n           \n may have the effect of creating doubts about the conduct and character of the officers \nconcerned. It can hardly be controverted that such a reference , although factually correct, if \ninadvertently made, cannot fail to damage the officer ‘s record even if in the long run he is \ncompletely exonerated.  \n 3. In the circumstances it is requested that, in the case of an officer against whom \ndepartmental proceedi ngs are in progress, no mention, whatsoever, should be made about it in \nhis annual confidential reports. Only when such proceedings have been finalized, and the \npunishment, if any, has been awarded, should a mention about it be made in his confidential \nreport. In such a case, a complete copy of the final order may be placed, as is usually done, on \nhis character roll.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

Admissible to Witnesses and Accused  Government  \nServant Summoned by an Inquiry Officer  \n A government servant summoned by an Inquiry Officer should be allowed TA as \nadmissible to him under S. R. 154 „et seq ‟ and he should draw it on a regular TA bill from \nhis own department on the strength of the Atte ndance Certificate furnished by the Inquiry \nOfficer and this should be debited against the office at whose instance the inquiry was being \nconducted, by book adjustment. In the case of a witness who is not a government servant, \ntravelling expenses should be  determined by the Inquiry Officer with reference to the status of \nthe witness and should be paid on the basis of the orders passed by the Inquiry Officer, by the \ndepartment at whose instance the inquiry was being conducted. The TA to be paid to a \nnon-government servant should, however, in no case exceed the maximum TA admissible to a \ngovernment servant of the highest grade. The provisions of S.R. 190 „et seq ‟ should also be \nkept in view in such cases.  \n[Authority . - Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No. 2/41/62 -D.I, da ted 28 -2-1963].  \n26.2 Admissibility of TA to Witness  \n  in Disciplinary Cases  \n In continuation of the Establishment Division O. M. No. 2/41/62 D. I, dated the 28th \nFebruary, 1963, a further question has since arisen as to whether the aforesaid provision of T A \nshould equally apply to the defence witness summoned by the Inquiry Officer in departmental \nproceedings. The point has been examined in  Establishment  Division in consultation with the \nMinistry of Finance. The position of the defence witnesses regarding s ummoning them and \npaying them TA is as explained hereunder.  \n 2. It is for the Inquiry Officer to consider if any particular witness cited by the \naccused as a defence witness is likely to be as essential witness for the purpose of defence or in \nother words,  for the determination of truth. If the Inquiry Officer agrees that the examination of \nthe witness will be essential, he may summon him and as soon as he summons him, he will take \n                         \nNow Performance Evaluation Reports.   Supplementary Rules.   et seq  abbr., and what follows; Latin ‗ et sequentia‟ . \nCHAPTER -8            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 827 \n \n upon himself the obligation to allow the witness reasonable TA. If the witne ss is an official, he \nis to draw the TA from his parent department on the strength of the attendance certificate \nfurnished by the Inquiry Officer, the amount being debited by book adjustment against the \noffice at whose instance the inquiry was conducted.  \n 3. If, however, the Inquiry Officer is not satisfied whether the examination of \na particular witness will be essential for the determination of truth he may at his \ndiscretion, refuse to summon such a witness. He may, however, agree to summon him on \nconditi on that the accused will bear the travelling expenses of the witness and he may \naccordingly require the accused to deposit with him the anticipated amount of the TA of \nthe witness, in advance, so that the witness could be paid therefrom. In that case, the \nattendance certificate to be furnished to the witness by the Inquiry Officer should contain \nthe endorsement that the witness has been paid his travelling expenses. This will debar the \nwitness from claiming the TA again from the government.  \n[Authority .- Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No. 2/41/62 -DI, dated 13 -4-1963].  \n26.3 Admissibility of TA to Government  \n Servants under Suspension  \n A question has since arisen as to whether a government servant under suspension \nwho was required to perform official journey as a witne ss or as an accused, would be \nentitled to TA. The question has been examined in Establishment  Division, in consultat -\nion with the Ministry of Finance, and it has been held that such a government servant \nwould be entitled to TA in such cases and his *grade and salary for that purpose would be \ntaken as if he was not under suspension.  \n[Authority . - Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No. 2/41/62 -DI, dated 19 -7-1963].  \n26.4 Framing of an Additional Charge During  \n Currency of the Disciplinary Proceedings  \n Instances have come to the notice of the Establishment Division that in cases where \nthe main charge of ―corruption ‖ or ―subversion ‖ was not proved, but there was sufficient \nevidence to establish the charge of ―misconduct the accused could not be punished because he \nhad not be en charged with misconduct ‖, although the offences of ―corruption ‖ and ―subvers -\nion‖ are the graver forms of ―misconduct ‖. To meet such exigencies, it has been decided in \nconsultation with the Law Division, that in all suitable cases where an accused is ch arged with \n―corruption ‖ or ―subversion ‖, an additional charge of ―misconduct ‖ may be added to the main \ncharge.  \n[Authority .- Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No. 2/5/66 -D.I, dated 11 -6-1966].  \n 27.1 Scope of Departmental Proceedings Under the Efficiency &  \nDiscipline R ules in Cases Referred to the Courts  \n References are very often received in the Establishment Division on the above \n                         \n* BPS.  \nPage - 828             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -8     \n           \n subject in various forms. The questions generally posed by the Ministries/  Divisions are \nas under :— \n (i) Whether departmental proceedings ca n be started against a government \nservant who is being prosecuted in a criminal court;  \n (ii) Whether departmental inquiry can be conducted against a government \nservant on the same charges after his acquittal by a court;  \n      (iii)   Whether any department al action lies against a government servant who \ncannot be prosecuted in a court of law due to technical grounds.  \n 2. The matter has been examined in consultation with Law Division. Each \ncase has to be decided on its merits and in the light of its facts and  circumstances. \nHowever some guidelines can be laid down in the matter, and the following general \nguidelines are indi cated for deciding such matters :- \n (i) There is no legal bar to the holding of a departmental inquiry against a \ngovernment servant who is b eing prosecuted in a criminal court.   It may, \nhowever, be pointed out that where the holding of department al inquiry \nside by side with the criminal proceedings may have the effect of impeding \nthe course of justice or of prejudicing the trial, the inquiry s hould be \ndeferred till the termination of criminal proceedings.  \n (ii) An acquittal from a criminal case may be on technical grounds or on the \nground that all the ingredients of the offence are not proved by the \nevidence produced in court. But in department al proceedings even one of \nthe ingredients, if proved, may be sufficient to reach a conclusion that the \naccused has misconducted himself or has acted in a grossly negligent way \nor has shown inefficiency in the discharge of his official duties. As an exampl e, \nto illustrate this poin t, a recent case may be cited. An officer employed in the \nRegistry of the Supreme Court was charged and tried for embezzlement. He \nwas, however, acquitted by the High Court in criminal appeal No. 676 of 1965. \nSubsequently, he was dismissed on the same allegations which were found \nproved in a departmental inquiry initiated by the Supreme Court. Thus \ndepartmental proceedings on the same facts may be started even if the person \nconcerned has been acquitted in criminal proceedings.  \n (iii) In some cases, a government servant cannot be criminally pr osecuted on \ntechnical grounds. But this does not bar the government from inquiring \ninto the truth of a charge against a government servant by means of a \ndepartmental inquiry.  Therefore, there i s no bar to proceed against a \ngovernment servant departmentally, when he cannot be criminally \nprosecuted in a court of law for some reason or other.  \n[Authority . - Estt.

This is obviously against dictates of justice.  \n 2. The disposal of disciplinar y proceeding assumes vital importance, especially \nin cases against government servants who are about to attain the age of superannuation. It \ngoes without saying that delay in disposal of such cases not only causes hardships to the \naffected persons but also  puts the administration to unnecessary criticism.  \n 3. It is, therefore, requested that disciplinary proceedings against government \nservants nearing the age of superannuation in future should be disposed of before they \nsuperannuate. All the agencies workin g under the administrative control of the Ministry \nconcerned should be advised accordingly.  \n[Authority. -Estt. Division ‘s O.M. No.12/2/88 -R.3, dated 3 -10-1988].  \n 27.3 Censure, Reprimand and Warning  \n From references received, it appears that some authorities  are not clear regarding \nthe procedure to be followed where punishment of Censure is awarded and regarding the \ndistinction between ‗Censure ‘ and ‗Warning ‘. \n 2. Censure is one of the punishments mentioned in *[rule 4 ( 2) (a) of the \nEfficiency and Discipline  Rules , 2020] . \n 3. There is essentially no difference between ‗Censure and reprimand ‘, but as \nthe official term is ‗Censure ‘, it seems preferable that normally this term should be used.  \n 4. [ Not reproduced ]  \n 5.   According to rule 3 of the Civil Servants  (Appeal) Rules, 1977, every civil \nservant is entitled to appeal to the appellate authority from an order of Censure passed by \nan authorized officer or an authority provided that, where the penalty is imposed by an \norder of the President, the civil servant  has no right to appeal but he can apply for review \nof the order.  \n 6.

Meanwhile, public complaints of corruption in several government \ndepartments persist, and effective steps are required to root it out. It is the bounden duty \nof every Head of Department to exercise utmost vigilance, analyse the cause, and trace \nthe source where incidence of corruption occurs.  \n 3. In future, a Head of Department will bear the responsibility, and be \nanswerable for proven charges of corruption within the area of his administrative \njurisdiction. It is self -evident that corruption prevails in a department if its Head is:  \n(a) himself corrupt, or  \nCHAPTER -8            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 831 \n \n (b) wilfully blind to corruption taking place, or  \n(c) so inefficient th at he is unable to control it.  \n 4. Whichever of these three reasons may be applicable, such a Head of \nDepartment cannot be retained in service to the detriment of government ‘s objective of \nserving the people and promoting their weal and welfare.  \n[Authority .- President of Pakistan ‘s note No. 57/l/CMLA, dated 25 -9-1978].  \n28.4 Loss of Security Passes to be  \nTreated as ‗Misconduct ‘ \n As provided in para 97 of the [Security Instructions] (1973 Edition) prepared by \nthe Cabinet Division and this Division ‘s Circular  letter No. 14/17/71 -Cord., dated the \n18th November, 1971, a government servant who has lost the Security  Pass issued to him \nis required :— \n (i) to make report to the Police Station and to the Head of his Department \nabout the loss of the Pass; and  \n (ii) to deposit Rs. 5 in the State Bank of Pakistan before a new Security Pass is \nissued to him. The amount of Rs.5 covers only the cost of the pass and \nactually no penalty has been imposed on him. It has been noticed that the \ngovernment servants generally do not take sufficient care to keep the \npasses in safe custody with the result that loss of security passes is on the \nincrease. As the pass lost can be misused by any unauthorized person \nwhich involves serious security risk, it has been decided, in consultation \nwith the authorities concerned, that the loss of Security Pass would be \ntreated as ―misconduct ‖ in terms of [Civil  Servants (Efficiency and \nDiscipline) Rules, 2020] . \n 2. However, before any action is initiated against a government servant who \nhas lost his Security Pass, it is necessary to determine, in each case as to whether the \nsecurity pass in question was lost due to negligence. If the government servant concerned \nis able to give a satisfactory account of the circumstances under which the security pass \nwas lost by him, it may not be proper to proceed against him. If, after preliminary inquiry, \nit is found that the Security Pass was lost due to the negligence of the government servant \nconcerned or that the lost Security Pass had fallen into unauthorized h ands as a result of \nany wilful omission or commission on his part, only then it would be appropriate to take \ndisciplinary action against him under the *[Civil  Servant s (E&D) Rules , 2020] . \n 3. All Ministries and Divisions are, therefore, requested that in f uture while \nreferring the case of issue of a Security Pass to a person who has already lost a Security \nPass, it may also please be clearly indicated whether disciplinary action, or if any, has \n                         \nModified as per Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2020 .  \nPage - 832             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -8     \n           \n been taken/is being taken a gainst the official concerned.  \n[Auth ority .- Ministry of Interior O.M.

While government servant s would be free to submit their representations in \naccordance with the prescribed procedure whenever they feel aggrieved, they should be \ninformed that the use of such language c onstitutes misconduct. You may, therefore, impress \nupon all government servants wo rking under your administrative control the need and \npropriety of refraining from the use of such language and to scrupulously observe the norms \nof decency and decorum.  Failure to do so on their part will not only result in no action being \ntaken on requests contained in such representations/petitions but will also render them li able \nto disciplinary action for misconduct. Serious action w ill also be taken when wild allegations \nare made against senior officers which, on investigations, are found to be without any basis.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

However, each case should be decided on its own merit by the competent au thority \nas defined in Rule 2 (1) of those Rules.  \n                         \nNow Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2020 . \nCHAPTER -8            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 833 \n \n 28.7 Grant of Arrears of Pay and Allowances to  Government Servants \nfor Period of Absence  from Duty, on Re -Instatement as a Result of \nCourt‘s Decisions  \n The Supreme Court, in its recent judgment in C.A. No.28  of 1969 [West Pakistan \nVS.  Mrs. A. V. Issacs], has ruled that a civil servant has and always had the right to recover \nsalary already accrued due to him despite the fact that his service was during ―Pleasure ‖. \nThis has rendered obsolete its own two earlie r judgments in the cases of Mehrajuddin [PLD \n1959 SC (Pak) 147] and Fazl -e-Haq Mussarrat [PLD 1960 SC (Pak) 208] and a judgment of \nthe former Federal Court in the case of Ali Ahmed Hussain Shah [PLD 1955 FC 522] all of \nwhich followed the Privy Council ‘s view on I. M. Lall ‘s case and which was also followed in  \nthe Law Ministry. In its latest judgment, the Supreme Court has taken the view that if the \ndismissal of a government servant is held to be unlawful he should be allowed salary for the \nperiod he was kep t out of service. This was, however, subject to the condition that if he has \naccepted other employment or engaged in other profitable business during this period, any \namount earned by him by way of salary from such employment or as profits of such business  \nwould have to be set off against the salary due, firstly because as government servant he \ncannot serve elsewhere or engage in any other business without the permission of the \ngovernment and secondly, because on general principle a person cannot be allowed  to reap a \ndouble advantage. Therefore, it would be no more open to the government to resist claim for \narrears of pay of a civil servant wrongfully removed from service on the plea that no such \nclaim was competent. The claim will have to be resisted, if at  all, on the facts of a particular \ncase referred to in the judgment as exceptional cases. The right of the government servant to \nclaim future salary has, however, been negatived by the court.  \n 2. In view of the latest judgment of the Supreme Court on the s ubject, a civil \nservant ‘s claim for arrears of salary in the relevant circumstances cannot now be refused. \nTherefore, Law Division ‘s earlier advice to the contrary must be deemed to have been recalled \nand the Establishment Division is requested to review, in consultation with the Ministry of \nFinance, all the pending cases relating to claims of arrears of pay in the light of the fresh \ndeclaration of law by the Supreme Court and settle such claims. The Supreme Court ‘s judgment \nunderlines the necessity of duly  observing with care the provisions of the Constitution and the \nGovernment Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, in all disciplinary cases against \ngovernment servants and of expeditious disposal of such cases.  \n[Authority .- Law Division ‘s O.M.No.F.7( 8)/70 -SOL(I), dated 12 -8-1970].  \n28.8 Reinstatement of Government Servants on Court   \nDecision and Functions of Enquiry Committee  \n A reference is invited to the O.M. from the Law Division No. F. 7(8)/70 -Sol(I), \ndated 12th August, 1970, which states, inter al ia, that, in accordance with the Supreme \nCourt ‘s judgment in CA No. 28 of 1969 (West Pakistan vs Mrs. A. V. Issacs), if the \ndismissal of a government servant is held to be unlawful, he has to be allowed salary for \n                         \nNow Civil Servants ( Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2020 . \nPage - 834             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -8     \n           \n the period he was kept out of service, red uced by the amount, if any, that he might have \nearned by way  of salary, or as profits, on account of having accepted some employment, \nor having been engaged in some profitable business, during the above period. Thus, the \nlegal status of government servant s‘ claims for arrears of pay and allowances is no longer \nthe same as had been indicated in para 3 of this Ministry ‘s circular d.o.  No.F.9(15) -RI \n(Rwp)/61, dated 23rd December, 1961 (Annex) . Consequently,  it is no longer appropriate \nfor the enquiry committe e referred to in para 4 of that circular D.O. to consider on merits, \nin cases in which government servants are restored to their posts as a result of court ‘s \ndecisions, as to whether or not, and to what extent, pay and allowance for the period of \ntheir abs ence from duty should be restored.  \n 2. It has accordingly been decided that, in cases where a government servant \nis reinstated retrospectively as a result of a court ‘s decision, the functions of the enquiry \ncommittee to be set up under para 4 of this Mini stry‘s circular d.o.No.F.9(15) -RI (Rwp)/61, \ndated 23rd  December, 1961, as amended (Annex) would henceforth be as follows: - \n(a) The Ministry/Division/Department as the case may be, may obtain from the \ngovernment servant concerned a solemn declaration, supp orted by an affidavit, \nas to the particulars of his employment, or engagement in profitable business, \nduring the period of his absence from duty, and the amount earned by him by \nway of salary from such employment, or as profits in such business.  \n(b) After examining such evidence as might be available, and cross -examining, if \nnecessary, the government servant, the Ministry/Division/ Department, as the \ncase may be, may give their finding as to whether or not the above declaration \nis, ‗prima facie ‟, acceptable  and on what grounds.  \n(c) If the declaration is found to be, ‗prima facie ‟, unacceptable, the \nMinistry/Division/Department, as the case may be, should refer the case to the \ncommittee, which, before giving their finding as to the amount earned by the \ngovern ment servant during the period of absence from duty, may get the \ndeclaration properly verified/  scrutinized by any agency they consider \nappropriate.  For example, if the case had been dealt with by the Special Police \nEstablishment at an earlier stage in a ny connection, this verification/scrutiny \nmay be arranged to be carried out by that Establishment. For purposes of this \nverification/security, assistance of the relevant Income -tax authorities, may also \nbe sought, if the government servant concerned be a n Income -tax payer.  \n(d) In case the reinstatement of the government servant has been ordered by the \ncourt on account of the relevant administrative action having been found to be \ndefective, the committee should also give their findings:  \n(i) as to which officer s were responsible for that defectiveness of \nadministrative action; and  \n                         \n FIA. \n Agency.  \nCHAPTER -8            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 835 \n \n  (ii) as to whether any, and what part, of the amount payable to the \ngovernment servant by way of net salary for the period of his absence \nfrom duty, might justifiably be recovered fro m such officers.  The \nrecovery from such officers will, of course, follow departmental \nproceedings under the Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) \nRules.  \n 3. The above instructions do not apply to cases in which government servants \nare reinstated  as a result of acceptance of appeals by departmental appellate authorities, \nwhich will continue to be regulated by the provisions of FR -54, as hitherto.  \n[Authority .- Finance Division ‘s O.M.No.781 -R4/73 -F.3(4) -R.I/73, dated 10 -7-1973].  \n(ANNEX)  \n [Extract of  Paras 4 & 5 of the Finance Division letter No. F.I(15) RI \n(Rwp)/61, dated 23rd December, 1961 as amended].  \n 4. If as a result of court ‘s decision, a government servant restored to his post, \nthe question whether pay and allowances for the period he was und er suspension or was \nremoved from service should be decided on the merit of each case. For this purpose, it is \nsuggested that in all cases the Ministry or Department concerned should order a \ndepartmental enquiry headed by the representative of the Ministry /Deptt. administratively \nconcerned with their Financial Adviser/  Deputy Financial Advise r as a member of the \nCommittee. This committee should consider whether, on the merits of the case, \ngovernment would be justified in restoring the official concerned, th e pay and allowances \nfor the period involved and, if so, whether in full or in part. In coming to a conclusion \nwhether pay and allowances to the individual should or should not be restored, following \nconsiderations will have to kept in view: — \n (a) whether the person concerned was acquitted on a purely technical or \nprocedural grounds or whether the actually allegations against him had \nbeen gone into and were found to be incorrect;  \n (b) whether the individual during the period he was away from active duty and  \nother sources of income; and so on.  \n 5. It has further been decided that in cases where the total period involved \ndoes not exceed 12 months from the time the individual was suspended or removed from \nservice, the final decision should be taken by the Minis try concerned at the level of the \nSecretary and in all other cases the matter should be referred to the Ministry of Finance \nfor prior concurrence.  \n \n                         \n Now Civil Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2020 . \nPage - 836             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -8     \n           \n 28.9 Grant of Arrears of Pay and Allowances to Government Servants \nfor Period of Absence  from Duty, on Reins tatement as a Result of  \nCourt‘s Decision  \n Due to certain subsequent developments, instructions issued vide Finance \nDivision circular D.O No. F -9(15)  R.I (Rwp)/61, dated 23 -12-1961 and O.M No. 781 -\nR4/73 -F.3(4) -R-I/73, dated 10 -07-1973  called for a revisio n. FR -53 and FR -54 have \nbeen amended and government servants under suspension are now entitled to a \nsubsistence grant equal to full pay and allowances. Similarly, employees reinstated in \nservice administratively or as a result of the court ‘s decision with consequential benefits \nare allowed salary for the period they stayed out of service.  \n 2. In view of the above, therefore, there is no need to refer cases to the \nFinance Division for payment of arrears of pay and allowance pertaining to the period of \nsuspen sion. In cases of reinstatement after removal/dismissal as a result of courts ‘ \ndecisions, however, the Ministry/Division/Department  concerned has to determine the \namount earned by the government servant concerned from other sources during the period \nhe rem ained out of service. For this purpose, the Ministry/Division/Department concerned \nshould obtain a solemn declaration from the government servant concerned in the form of \nan affidavit as to the particulars of his employment/business or any other profitable  work \nundertaken by him during the period of his absence from duty and the amount earned \nthere from. The case should, then, be examined by a Departmental Enquiry Committee on \nwhich Finance Division may be represented by the FA/DFA concerned . The Committee  \nmay examine such other evidence as it may require and give its findings and \nrecommendations to the Secretary of the Ministry / Division concerned for such orders as \nhe may deem appropriate.  \n[Authority : Estt.

As some doubts \nseemed to exist in the matter, the question has been fully considered in consultation with \nthe Law Division and it has been decided that the f ollowing procedure should be adopted \nto regulate cases of detention in prison and subs equent acquittal or conviction: — \n (i) As soon as it comes to notice that an employee has been detained in \nprison, action should be taken to place him under suspension. Th e period \nof the employee ‘s detention [should be treated as period spent under] \ncommittal to prison within the meaning of Article 194 C.S.R. and the pay \nand allowances during suspension should be regulated under F.R.53.  \n (ii) If the employee is subsequentl y acquitted honourably, he should be \nreinstated forthwith.  He will be entitled to receive full salary for the entire \nperiod of his absence from duty under F.R. 54(a).  \n (iii)   If on the other hand, the acquittal is not honourable, then the provision of \nF.R. 54 (b) will apply.  \n (iv) If the employee is released from detention without any trial, it is open to \nthe competent authority to take disciplinary action against him if good and \nsufficient reasons exist from such action. In that case the procedure \nprescr ibed in the Efficiency and Discipline Rules must be observed.  \n (v) If the employee is convicted, he may be dismissed from service if his \nretention in service is not desirable.  In that case, t he procedure prescribed \nin the Efficien cy and Discipline Rules, need not be observed. He will be \nentitled to nothing more than the subsistence allowance up to the date of his \ndismissal from which date the pay and allowance will cease under F.R. 52.  \n[Authority .-Estt.

These words, as they stand, are capable of being interpreted as if a \nperson who is detained under the Public Safety Act will be governed b y the provisions of \nArticle 194, Civil Service Regulations, as it stands. The position, however, is that Article \n194 does not strictly apply to such cases but the intention is that, when a person is \ndetained under the Public Safety Act, his pay and allowan ces should, on the analogy of \nthe provisions of Article 194, be regulated as if he was committed to prison.  In order to \nmake this intention clear, it has been decided that the words ―considered as resulting \nfrom ‖ referred to above may be replaced by the w ords ―treated as period spent under ‖. \n[Authority. -Estt.

No. 3/24/59 -SE.I, d ated the 21st March, 1959].  \n References have been received from time to time from Ministries and Divisions \netc. enquiring whether a government servant convicted by a court of law can be removed \nor dismissed from service or reduced in rank straightaway or i t is necessary to give him a \nshow cause notice before passing final orders in the matter.  \n 2. This question has been given due consideration in the Establishment \nDivision who are of the view that,  as a general principle, if a government servant is \nconvicte d in a court of law he does not automatically lose hi s employment under \ngovernment. But if in the opinion of the authority competent to pass orders of dismissal, \nremoval or reduction in rank grounds which led to his conviction are good and sufficient \nfor imposing any of these penalties, that authority can pass such an order. If, however, the \ncompetent authority considers that a lesser penalty or no penalty at all is called for in the \ncircumstances of the case (such as minor or technical nature) there is no bar to that \nauthority taking a decision accordingly.  \n 3. If it is decided to award the penalty of dismissal, removal or reduction in \nrank it is not necessary to give a show cause notice to the person concerned vide Article \n181 (2) proviso (a) of the late C onstitution or Rule 55 of the Civil Services (Classification, \nControl and Appeal) Rules [Article 177 (I) (b) of the 1962 Constitution or rule 6 of the \nEfficiency and Discipline Rules, 1960 may be referred to in the present context].The order of \nremoval, di smissal or reduction can be passed by the competent authority taking into \nconsideration the grounds of conduct which led to the conviction of the person concerned in the \ncourt of law.  The removal, dismissal or reduction in such cases takes effect from the  date of \norders and not from the date of verdict passed by the court.  \n                         \nNow Civil Servants (Effic iency and Discipline) Rules,2020.  \nCHAPTER -8            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 839 \n \n Sl.No.30  \nStricture s Passed by Courts Against Government Servants  \n The question, whether strictures passed by courts of law against a government \nservant render him liable to departmental action, has been under consideration of the \nEstablishment Division for some time. It has been held that when a court passed any \nstrictures against a government servant, it should not necessarily be assumed that he is \nguilty of some misconduct or breach of rules or an act of omission or commission. The \nnature of the action to be taken should be decided after careful consideration of the facts \nand circumstances of each individual case. If the strictures are such as to merit \ndisciplinary action against the gov ernment servant concerned, he should be dealt with \ndepartmentally in the light of the Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) \nRules. No government servant should, however, be punished on the basis of the strictures \nwithout drawing up necessary pro ceedings in accordance with the aforesaid rules. An \nentry may be made in the Character Roll of the government servant concerned or a copy \nof the strictures placed therein only when specific orders are passed to that effect by the \ncompetent authority. In no  other case, strictures should find a place in the Character Roll \nof the government servant.  \n[Authority .- Estt. Division ‘s O.M.  No. 3/110/59 -E.V., dated 28 -4-1960].  \n 31.1 False or Forged Information about Educational  \nQualifications and Age and Pakistan Pe nal Code  \n Government of Pakistan do not agree with the views expressed by the \nGovernment of East Pakistan in their letter No. 2070 -GAC, dated 9th December, 1958 \nthat the furnishing of false information by candidates for posts in government service is \npunis hable under section 177 of the Pakistan Penal Code. Section 177 of the Pakistan \nPenal Code deals with the cases of persons legally bound to furnish information to a \npublic servant, whereas there is no legal obligation in the part of a candidate to furnish \ninformation when applying for a post in government service.  The offence of furnishing \nfalse information in such cases is not, therefore, punishable under section 177, but under \nsection 182 of the Pakistan Penal Code.  \n 2. As for tampering with the date of birth as recorded in an educational \ncertificate, it is considered that this amounts to forgery within the meaning of section 463 \nof the Pakistan Penal Code. The forging of certificates to support false assertions of \neducational qualifications would appear to be punishable under section 465, and the use \nof forged certificates punishable under section 468 of the Pakistan Penal Code. It is \nconsidered that these offences, which are punishable with long periods of imprisonment, \ncannot be tried summarily for the reason that, under section 260 of the Code of Criminal \nProcedure, only offences punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding six \nmonths can be tried summarily.  \n                         \nNow Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules,2020.  \nPage - 840             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -8     \n           \n  3. In the circumstances, prosecution for the offences mentioned above should \nbe restri cted to cases of false information under section 182 of the Pakistan Penal Code, \nignoring the offence of forgery where it is also present. Steps should also be taken to have \nthe cases tried in a summary manner under sub -section (1) of section 260 of the Co de of \nCriminal Procedure, 1898.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

It is requested that the above decisions may please be brought to the notice of \nall government servants serving under the Government of Pakistan.  \n[Authority .- Estt. Division ‘s O.M.

Meanwhile, public complaints of corruption in several government departments \npersist, and effective steps are required to root it out. It is the bounden duty of every Head of \nDepartment to exercise utmost vigilance, analyse the cause, and  trace the source where \nincidence of corruption occurs.  \n 3. In future, a Head of Department will bear responsibility, and be answerable for \nproven charges of corruption within the area of his administrative jurisdiction.  It is \nself-evident that corruption  prevails in a department of its Head is:  \n(a) himself corrupt, or  \n(b) wilfully blind to corruption taking place, or  \nCHAPTER -8            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 841 \n \n (c) so inefficient that he is unable to control it.  \n 4. Whichever of these three reasons may be applicable, such a Head of \nDepartment cannot  be retained in service to the detriment of government ‘s objective of \nserving the people and promoting their weal and welfare.  \n[Authority .- President and CMLA ‘s Note No.57/1/CMLA, dated 25 -9-1978].  \n 32.2 Co-operation with Investigating Officers  \nof the Fede ral Investigating Agency  \n The New Federal Investigation Agency has been constituted by the Government \nof Pakistan for the investigation of cases of bribery and corruption involving persons \nserving in connection with the affairs of the Centre. The cases of  corruption usually \nrelate to the functions of the public servants concerned and involve the examination of \nofficial record for coming to a conclusion whether an offence has been committed or not. \nInstances have come to notice that in some cases when the I nvestigating Officers of the \nSpecial Police Establishment approached the departments for papers relevant to the \ncases under investigation, the officers concerned delayed handing over of papers on one \npretext or the other and in some cases, even refused t o hand over the documents. They \nwere perhaps not aware that under section 94 of the Criminal Procedure Code, an \nInvestigating Officer is empowered to demand the pro duction of any paper connected \nwith the offence, the  investigation of which is being conduct ed by him and omission to \ncomply is punishable under section 175 of the Pakistan Penal Code.  Even otherwise, it is \nthe duty of each public servant to assist the anti -corruption agencies in their arduous t ask \nof eradicating corruption. The responsibility of  the Heads of Departments in this matter \nhas also been emphasized in this Ministry ‘s Office Memorandum No. 1/8/67 -SP (P), \ndated the 20th September,  1967. Delay in the investigation of corruption cases is \ndetrimental to the prosecution and goes in favour of  the accused who gets a chance to \ntamper with the record and win over the witnesses before the police can examine them. It \nis, therefore, requested that suitable instructions may be issued to all concerned \nimpressing upon them the need for prompt handing o ver of the requisite record to the \nInvestigating Officers and the desirability of extending full co -operation to them in the \ninvestigation of corruption cases.  \n[Authority .- Interior Division ‘s O.M.

When the identity of the complainant is known, the Agency shall ascertain \nfrom him full facts in support of his allegations and shall, after doing so, proceed in the \nmanner laid down in the succeeding paragraphs.  \n 4.

The position is clarified as under: – \n(i) Supreme Court in their judgeme nt in Civil Appeals Nos.154  and 155 of 1988  \nheld that organizations established through Resolutions were not bodies \ncorporate but government departments and their employees were held to be \ncivil servants.  In the light of the aforesaid decision of the Supr eme Court, Civil \nServants Act, 1973  and the rules made thereunder are applicable to the \nemployees of organizations established through Resolutions.  \n(ii) In case of autonomous bodies which are bodies corporate and are \nadministered or controlled by Federal Govern ment, and have their own \nservice rules/regulations, it is necessary to make enabling provision in their \nservice rules/regulations on the lines of section 13(1)(i) of Civil Servants \nAct, 1973.  \n 2. Ministries/Divisions are advised to take necessary action fo r making \nenabling provision in the Service Rules/ Regulations of Bodies Corporate which are under \ntheir administrative control.  \n[Authority .– Establishment Division ‘s O.M.No.8/31/2000 -R.3, dated 11 -10-2000].  \n 35.2 Clarification Regarding Option of  \nSeeking Premature Retirement  \n  The amended section 13(1)(i) of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 lays down that – \n ―(1)  a civil servant shall retire from service – \n(i) On such date after he has completed twenty years of service qualifying for \npension and other retirement be nefits as the competent authority may, in \npublic interest, direct.  \n 2.  However, queries have been received in the Establishment Division \nsoliciting advice on the point as to whether, or not, a civil servant can seek voluntary \nretirement on completion of t wenty years of service qualifying for pension and other \nretiring benefits under section 13(1)(i) of the Civil Servants Act, 1973.  \n 3. As such, it is clarified that there is no provision in the Civil Servants Act, \n1973  under which a civil servant can seek v oluntary retirement on completion of twenty \nyears of service qualifying for pension and other retirement benefits. However, all \ngovernment servants have the right to seek retirement – if they so desire – on the \nCHAPTER -8            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                Page - 895 \n \n completion of twenty five years service quali fying for pension and other retirement \nbenefits (under CSR 465 -B). This right is, however, subject to the provisions of the \nEssential Services Maintenance Act 1952 and is not available to a civil servant against \nwhom the departmental inquiry/proceedings ar e pending.  \n[Authority .– Estt. Div. ‘s O.M.No.3/8/2000/R.2, dated 22 -10-2001].  \n 35.3 Implications of Release of a Government Servant  \n  under Section 25 of Ordinance No. XVIII of 1999  \n  for Disciplinary Proceedings  \n Section 25 of NAB Ordinance (Ordinance No . XVIII of 1999) lays down, inter \nalia as under: - \n ―25. (a) Where at any time whether before or after the commencement of trial the \nholder of a public notice or any other person accused of any offence under this Ordinance, \nreturns to the NAB, the assets or  gains acquired through corruption or corrupt practices, - \n(i) if the trial has not commenced, the Chairman NAB may release the accused; \nand \n(ii) if the Court has taken cognizance of the offence or the trial has commenced, \nthe Chairman NAB may, with the approval of the Court, release the accused.  \n 2. A question had arisen whether release of a government servant under \nsection 25 should be construed as an order of conviction, and thereby automatically \ndisqualify him for holding the office which he was holding prior to initiation of proceedings \nagainst him under the said Ordinance. The matter has been examined in consultation with the \nLaw and Justice Division and correct leg al position is clarified below: - \n (a) The voluntary return of gains and release of the accused for  return of \nmoney are matters unconnected with the terms and conditions of service of \ncivil servants. Neither any presumption can be drawn against him nor he \ncan be considered disqualified only on such facts unless the civil servant \nconcerned is subjected t o disciplinary proceedings as per provisions of the \nlaw and the rules.  \n (b) Though the release of a government servant under section 25 of the said \nOrdinance does not automatically disqualify him for holding his office but \nit makes him liable to face disci plinary proceedings in regard to charges of \ncorruption mentioned in section 25 of Ordinance No. XVIII of 1999 but \nthis liability should be without prejudice to the right of a government \nservant to:  \n (i) be informed in writing about the action proposed to be taken against \nhim and the grounds of the action; and  \nPage - 896             ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                              CHAPTER -8     \n           \n  (ii) be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the \naction proposed to be taken against him.  \n 3. If follows from the above stated position that the Ministry/  Division/  \nDepartment conc erned is required to initiate disciplinary proceedings in accordance with \nthe law, if a government servant is released under section 25 of the NAB Ordinance.  \n 4. The above clarification is being circulated for information and guidance of \nall Ministries/Div isions/Departments.  \n[Authority : Estt. Div. ‘s OM No. 3/65/2000 -R.2, dated 3rd November 2000]  \nSl.No. 36 \nEmployment/Re -employment of Persons Penalized Under the Government Servants \n(Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 1973 and the Removal from Service (Special \nPowers) Ordinance, 2000   \n Reference the Estab. Div .‘s OM No. 22/4/71 -F.1, dated 3 -4-1973 under which \nMinistries/Division s/Departments were required to consult the list circulated by the \nEstablishment Division, of persons dismissed from government service f or consultation \nbefore making fresh appointments. As the number of Ministries/  Divisions/Departments \nand government servants both have increased tremendously since the issuance of above \nreferred instructions neither the information required for preparation  of lists from the \nMinistries/Divisions is received nor has it now been possible to prepare and circulate lists,  \nkeeping in view the voluminous data. Further, to reduce the workload and in the public \ninterest, powers to initiate and finalize disciplinary p roceedings in cases of employees \nfrom BPS -1 to BPS 19 and equivalent stand delegated to the respective authorities.  \n 2. It has now been decided that, in case of a person having served somewhere \nunder the government before his candidature for fresh appointm ent or re -employment, \nMinistries/Divisions/Departments shall consult the parent organization of the person to be \nappointed/re -employed to find out whether he was penalized under the Government \nServants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 1973 or the *Removal from Service (Special \nPowers) Ordinance, 2000 or had retired from service voluntarily. If a person is found to \nhave been dismissed from service or retired on his request, he shall not be appointed/re -\nemployed. In case of other penalties, the appointing aut hority may decide whether a \npenalized candida te may or may not be appointed/ re-employed.  \n[Authority:  Estab. Div. ‘s O.M.

Retirement from Service  \n   (Statutory Provisions)  \n 1.1 Retirement on Completion  \n  of Sixtieth Year of Age  \n Sections 13 & 19 of Civil Servants Act, 1973  which provides the legal provisions  \nfor retirement , are reproduced below: —  \n 13. [Retirement from service .–(1) A  civil servant shall retire from service – \n(i)  on such date after he has completed [twenty] years of service qualifying for \npension or other retirement benefits as the competent authority may, in public \ninterest, direct; or  \n(ii)  where  no direction is given under clause (i), on the completion of the \nsixtieth year of his age.  \n (2)  No direction under clause (i) of sub -section (1) shall be made until the \ncivil servant has been informed in writing of the grounds on which it is proposed to make \nthe direction, and has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the \nsaid direction.  \n Explanation:  In this Section, ―competent authority ‖ means the appointing \nauthority prescribed in rule 6 of the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion and \nTransfer) Rules, 1973].  \n 19.  Pension and Gratuity .– (1) On retirement from service, a civil servant \nshall be entitled to receive such pension or gratuit y as may be prescribed.  \n (2)   In the event of the death of a civil servant, whether before or after retirement, \nhis family shall be entitled to receive such pension, or gratuity, or both, as may be prescribed.  \n (3) No pension shall be admissible to a civi l servant who is dismissed or \nremoved from service for reasons of discipline, but Government may sanction \ncompassionate allowance to such a civil servant, not exceeding two -thirds of the pension \nor gratuity which would have been admissible to him had he be en invalided from service \non the date of such dismissal or removal.  \n                                                           \n Subs. vide Civil Servants (Amendment) Ordinance No. XX of 2000, dated 1 -6-2000.  \n Subs. vide Civil Servants (Amendment) Ordinance No. XXXIV of 2001, promulgated on 4 -8-2001.  \n    Page - 904                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                 CHAPTER -9 \n \n  (4) If the determination of the amount of pension or gratuity admissible to a \ncivil servant is delayed beyond one month of the date of his retirement or death, he or his \nfamily, as the ca se may be, shall be paid provisionally such anticipatory pension or \ngratuity as may be determined by the prescribed authority, according to the length of \nservice of the civil servant which qualifies for pension or gratuity; and any over payment \nconsequent on such provisional payment shall be adjusted against the amount of pension \nor gratuity finally determined as payable to such civil servant or his family.  \n[Authority: - Civil Servants Act, 1973, Section s 13 & 19 .] \n 1.2 Authorities Competent to Accept  \nRequests for Retirement   \n A reference is invited to the Establishment Division's Office Memorandum No. \n1/2/67 -CV, dated the 6th December, 1967 (Annex)  in which it was stated that it was not \nnecessary to submit requests for retirement on completion of 25 y ears' qualifying service to \nthe President for orders where the appointing authority was the *President. This was so \nbecause government had allowed all civil servants the right to apply for retirement and the \nintimation of intention to retire once submitte d by a civil servant was final and could not be \nmodified or withdrawn.

The matter has been examined, in consultation with the Law Division and the \nFinance Division, and it has been decid ed that the right to retire from service accrues to a \ngovernment servant only after he has completed 25 years' service qualifying for pension.  As \nsuch, he can exercise the said option and submit a written intimation of his intention to retire \nonly after t he date of completion of his 25 years' service qualifying for pension.  Application \nfor L.P.R***., if due, shall also be submitted after that date.  \n 3.  If a government servant desires to leave service before completion of his 25 \nyears' service qualifying for pension, he may do so by tendering resignation from service. In \nthat case he will not be entitled to any pensionary benefits.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division‘s O.M.

A number of cases have \ncome to the notice of Finance Division in which it was found, after such an application for \nretirement under para 5 of the O.M referred to above has been submitted and accepted by the \ncompetent authority and the government servant had actually retired, tha t the 25 years \nqualifying service for pension had not been rendered e.g. the period of extra -ordinary leave \nhad not been excluded from service. As such the government servant became altogether \nineligible for pension, which caused hardship. In order to avoi d recurrence of such cases in \nfuture and to avoid resultant hardship to the retired government servant concerned it has been \ndecided that the application on for retirement after completion of 25 years qualifying service \nmust be accompanied by particulars a s in the enclosed form. These particulars are based on \nthe pension application form and are intended for the purpose of calculating qualifying \nservice. On receipt of the application, the Head of Department should arrange verification of \nthe qualifying serv ice by the Audit Officer within one month from the date of the receipt of \nthe application before orders of retirement are passed.  \n[Authority. — Finance Division O.M No. F.8(5) -Reg (6)/73 dated 4th January,1975]  \n \n                                                           \nAmended in terms of CSR 907.  \n CHAPTER -9                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                             Page - 907 \n \n    1.7 Notifying Retirement of an  \nOfficer on Attaining the Age  \nof Superannuation  \n It has come to notice of the Establishment Division that in some cases no \nnotification was issued regarding retirement of the officer who retired from service on \nattaining the age of superannuation, i.e., the age of 60 years. The absence of a notification \nregarding the retirement led to delay in payment of the pension and other dues. The \nmatter has, therefore, been considered by the Establishment Division and it is stated that \nwhile a notification may not b e necessary in the case of officers who attain the age of \nsuperannuation for retiring them from service, it is necessary to notify the retirement of \nsuch officers to all concerned for the recovery of dues from the officers, if any, and to \nfacilitate paymen t of pension and other dues of the officers. The Ministries/Divisions are, \ntherefore, requested to ensure that retirement of officers working under them are notified \nwell in time even if the officer concerned does not take leave preparatory to retirement. In \ncase the retiring officer is on deputation with the Ministry/  Division or with any of their \nAttached Departments/ Subordinate Offices and the orders regarding his retirement are to \nbe issued by his parent Ministry/Department, that Ministry/ Department m ay please be \ninformed of the date of retirement of the officer so that they may issue notification \nregarding his retirement.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

RE-EMPLOYMENT  \n 4.1 Employment after Retirement - Policy and  \nProcedure – Re-employment after Superannuation  \n It has been noticed that Ministries/Divisions initiate proposals for re -employment of \ngovernment servants after superannuation as a routine measure. It is emphasized that \nre-employment beyond superannuation should be an exception and not the rule. It may be \nrecommended only in cases where government considers that the experience gained by the \nretiring person is of vital importance and can be g ainfully utilized, particularly in fields \nwhere suitably qualified and experienced persons are not available.  \n 2.  For achievement of the objective mentioned above, the government has \nframed a policy for re -employment of government servants and cases for r e-employment \nwould, in future, be considered in accordance with the following criteria:  \n (i) non-availability of suitably qualified or experienced officers to replace the \nretiring officer;  \n (ii) the officer is a highly competent person with distinction in his \nprofession/field;  \n   (iii) the re -employment does not cause a promotion block; and  \n (iv) retention of the retiring officer, for a specified period, is in the public interest.  \n This policy would also apply to government controlled corporations and other  \nautonomous bodies.  \n 3.  Proposals for re -employment are required to be accompanied with the \nfollowing documents/information: - \n (a) the proposal duly signed by Secretary or Additional Secretary Incharge of the \nMinistry concerned to be received in the Estab lishment Division 6 months \nbefore the officer is due to attain the age of superannuation and has the \napproval of the Minister Incharge;  \n (b) the steps taken to train the substitute, if any;  \n (c) PERs with photograph, ICP chart and bio -data on prescribed pr oforma; and  \n (d) certificate that the officer is medically fit.  \n 4.  Re-employment beyond the age of superannuation in all cases requires the \napproval of the Prime Minister.  While submitting summaries for re -employment /extension \nin re -employment on the pr escribed proforma, as circulated vide Establishment Secretary \nD.O letter No. 4/1/84 -R-I dated 08 -08-1985 as Annex.  \n 5.  It is requested to instruct all concerned in Ministries/ Divisions and Attached \nDepartments/autonomous bodies to strictly follow the gui delines given above.  \n[Authority. - Establishment Secretary's D.O. letter No.7/3/ 89 -OMG -II dated 28 -01-1989].  \n \n \n CHAPTER -9                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                             Page - 917 \n \n (ANNEX)  \n \nBIO-DATA FORM  \n(TO BE USED IN RE -EMPLOYMENT CASES)  \n1.

Submission of such proposals to the Prime Minister \n                                                           \n BPS/Post.  \n    Page - 918                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                 CHAPTER -9 \n \n without indication of date of birth amounts to d isguised recommendation for re -\nemployment. The competent authority has viewed the aforesaid lapse with displeasure \nand has directed that all proposals entailing to appointment to tenure posts should, \nbesides providing other relevant information, specifical ly mention the date of \nsuperannuation of the recommendee so that the competent authority may be able to \nexercise conscious discretion in regard to appointing a person to a tenure post involving \nhis retention in public service beyond the date of his superan nuation.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division‘s O.M. No.1/134/99 -E.6, dated 3 -9-1999].  \n 4.3 Re-employment of Civil Servants After Compulsory  \nRetirement or Termination of Service  \n A person, whose services have been terminated as a result of a disciplinary action \nagainst him, or retrenched due to winding up of an organization (where he was serving) \non grounds of its having been set up irregularly, will not be re -employed without \nobtaining the orders of the President. \n 2.  Such cases for re -employment of persons, i n all grades, both in \ngovernment service and corporations etc., should be submitted by the Ministry concerned \n(together with its recommendations and bio -data of the proposed person), through the \nEstablishment Division, to the *President for orders.  Such  a proposal shall be made in \nthe form of a ―Summary ‖, containing t he approval of the Minister -in-Charge, and signed \nby the Secretary or Additional Secretary Incharge.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division‘s O.M. No. 2/6/78 -CV, dated 08 -1-1979].  \n 4.4 Re-employment During Refused L.P.R  \n A question has arisen whether a government servant, whose L.P.R. has been \nrefused, should be recommended for re -employment on the same post, after \nsuperannuation.  \n 2.  It   has been decided that as a matter of policy, re -employment, b eyond \nsuperannuation, may not be initiated as the period of refused L.P.R. gives ample time to \nfind out replacement of the retiring officer. In exceptional cases, where re -employment \nbeyond superannuation is inevitable, the reasons therefor may specificall y be brought out \nin the ―Summary for the *President ‖. \n [Authority. - Estt. Division‘s O.M. No. 3/60/81, dated 17 -11-1982].  \n 4.5 Re-employment after Superannuation  \nby Corporations/ Autonomous Bodies  \n It has time and again been stressed that the approval of the President* would be \nnecessary in all cases of re -employment after the age of superannuation in government as \nwell as in the autonomous bodies. In this connection attention is invited to Establishment \nSecretary's D.O. letter No. 8/l/72 -CV, dated 29 -5-1972 and Estt . Div.‘s O.M. No. 2/2/  \n78- CV, dated 24 -12-1978. According to these instructions the age of superannuation of \nall government servants should be 60 years and this should apply equally to government \n                                                           \n Prime Minister.  \n BPS.  \n CHAPTER -9                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                             Page - 919 \n \n controlled corporations/ autonomous bodies etc. and if such organizations have \nprescribed age beyond 60 years they were required to amend their recruitment/service \nrules and inform the Establishment Division of compliance. It was abundantly made clear \nthat in case no communication was received, it would  be assumed that the age of \nsuperannuation, as prescribed in their rules, is 60 years.  \n 2.  Contrary to the explicit instructions referred to above, it has come to \nnotice that corporations/autonomous bodies have been re -employing persons after the \ndate of superannuation without obtaining prior approval of the *President.  \n 3.  It is, therefore, reiterated that no person who has already attained the age \nof 60 years should be allowed to be in employment without obtaining prior approval of \nthe President. \n[Authority. - Estt. Division‘s O.M. No. 2/48/84 -ABC dated 23 -1-1985].  \n 4.6 Cabinet Decision Regarding  \nRe-employment  \n The Cabinet in its meeting held on 12 -11-1990 has decided that no re -\nemployment beyond the age of superannuation should be allowed except i n very \nexceptional cases for which approval of the Prime Minister would need to be obtained.  \n 2.  This decision is also applicable to autonomous bodies/semi -autonomous \nbodies and may please be brought to their notice for strict compliance.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division‘s O.M. No.4/2/90 -R.I dated 5 -12-1990].  \n4.7 Re-employment beyond  \nSuperannuation in Unavoidable  \nCases  \n The Ministries/Divisions are advised not to initiate cases of re -employment of \ncivil servants beyond the age of superannuation unless that is  considered unavoidable due \nto non -availability of his replacement and the importance and sensitivity of the job which \nmust be clearly brought out while initiating any such proposal.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division‘s O.M. No.4/1/93 -R.I dated 27 -8-1995].  \n 5.1 Continuation in Service Beyond Superannuation  \n The Prime Minister has taken serious notice of cases in which civil servants \nwere allowed to continue in service beyond the date on which they attained the age of \nsuperannuation or completed the specified peri od of their re -employment on contract \nsimply on the grounds that proposals for their re -employment beyond the age of 60 or \nbeyond the period of re -employment had been submitted or were being submitted. This \npractice is in violation of government's clear in structions issued time and again.  In this \nconnection, attention is invited to circular (d.o. letter No. 4/1/84 -R.I dated 20 -6-1984).  \n                                                           \n Prime Minister.  \n    Page - 920                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                 CHAPTER -9 \n \n  2.  The procedure for employment of civil servants after retirement should be \nstrictly followed. It should particularly b e ensured that all proposals for re -employment \nbeyond the age of 60 or for extension of the period of current re -employment are made at  \nleast 6 months before the date of attaining the age of superannuation or the date of expiry of \nthe current period of re -employment, as the case may be.  \n 3.  In case a proposal for re -employment has been submitted and no decision has \nbeen received by the date on which the civil servant concerned attains the age of 60 or \ncompletes the current period of re -employment, it is th e responsibility of the head of office to \nensure that the civil servant relinquishes the charge on such date.  \n[Authority. - Establishment Secretary's D.O. No. 4/1/84 -R.I, dated 8 -8-1985].  \n 5.2 Guard Against Unauthorised Overstayal  \nafter Superannuation/on Expiry of the  \nPeriod of Contract Re -employment  \n It has been observed by the Establishment Division in certain cases that officers \non superannuation or on expiry of contract re -employment continue in office which is \nviolation of th e existing instructions issued on the subject from time to time. Attention is \ninvited to this Division's D.O. letters No. 5/10/83 -E-4, dated 23 -4-1983, No.4/1/84 -R.1, \ndated 20 -11-1986, O.M.No.4/1/84 -R.1, dated 2 -9-1990 and O.M. No.4/2/90 -R.1, dated 5 -\n12-1990. \n 2.  In view of the above, all the Ministries/Divisions are requested to ensure \nthat the instructions already issued by the Establishment Division are complied with in \nletter and spirit and no officer is allowed to continue in office after superannuati on/on \nexpiry of the period of contract re -employment unless prior approval of the competent \nauthority is obtained in advance. In case of unauthorized overstayal, the financial liability \nfor such an irregularity shall rest upon the head of the department an d the officer \nconcerned himself.  \n 3.  If it is intended to get the retiring person re -employed on contract in public \ninterest or to get his contract extended, a proposal in the form of a summary for the Prime \nMinister should be submitted to Establishment D ivision about six months in advance \nfrom the date of his retirement from service/expiry of the contract so that Establishment \nDivision could have sufficient time to process it properly.  \n 4.  The proposal for re -employment on contract/extension in contract should \ninvariably contain the following information: - \n (a) A brief report on the performance of the officer during the period of his \ncontract re -employment (only for the cases for extension in contract).  \n (b) Certificate that the proposed re -employment/ ex tension in contract will not \ncreate promotion blockade for the departmental officers.  \n (c) Steps taken to train a substitute of the officer and a statement of \ncircumstances in which no officer could be groomed to take up the \nassignment.  \n CHAPTER -9                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                             Page - 921 \n \n  5.  No request for  grant of ex -post-facto approval to the contract re -\nemployment/  extension in contract, in any circumstances, will be entertained.  \n 6.  All the Ministries/Divisions are requested to strictly abide by the above \nguidelines. If a proposal, floated on the subje ct, either fails to give adequate information, \nas mentioned above or is not received in the Establishment Division in time, the same \nwill be liable to be summarily rejected by the Establishment Division and will not be \nprocessed further.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

The Prime Minister has been pleased to decide that requests for re -\nemployment of ex -civil servants, who have voluntarily retired from service, shall be \nsummarily rejec ted.

The President has now been pleased to decide that, in supersession of all previous \norders on the above subject, the pay of retired government servant on re -employment shall \nbe fixed in accordance with the following principles: - \n (i) Where the new post c arries a fixed pay, he should be allowed the pay of that \npost less pension.  \n (ii) Where the new post carries a time -scale of pay: - \n (a) If the substantive pay last drawn by the officer before retirement was \nless than the minimum of the scale of the new post, he should be \nallowed the minimum of the scale less pension.  \n (b) If the substantive pay last drawn was more than the minimum of the \nscale but less than the maximum of the scale of the new post, his pay \nshould be fixed at the stage in the scale corres ponding to the pay last \ndrawn, or if there be no such stage, at the next lower stage in the scale.  \nFrom the pay so fixed the amount of pension should be deducted.  \n (c) Where the substantive pay last drawn was more than the maximum of \nthe scale of the new post the pay should be fixed at the maximum less \npension.  \n  (iii) A re-employed government servant should earn increments in all cases where \npay has been fixed in a scale at a stage lower than the maximum.  \n (iv) In case a re -employed pensioner is promoted to a higher post, his pay should \nbe fixed in such a manner as if he was a serving officer with the difference \nthat from the pay so determined the pension would be deducted.  \n (v) In a case where officiating pay higher than the substantive pay was drawn for \na continuous period of 3 years or more immediately before retirement, the \nofficiating pay drawn before retirement may be treated as substantive pay for \nthe purpose of these orders.  \n CHAPTER -9                            ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                             Page - 927 \n \n  2.  The above principles should be made applicable to employment in \nautono mous bodies and public limited companies in which government holds controlling \nshares.  \n 3.  These principles should be followed in case of appointments to statutory \nposts as those of Governors, Speakers, Ministers etc.  A retired official appointed to any \nstatutory post should draw the pay of the post less the amount of pension drawn by him.  \n 4.  The pay of the retired military personnel, re -employed in civil posts, may \nalso be fixed in accordance with the above principles. In their case substantive pay sh all also \ninclude the following elements; provided that they were drawn before \nretirement/release/leave/leave pending retirement for a contin uous period of 3 years or \nmore: — \n (a) Command/Staff/Charge Pay.  \n (b) Instructional pay.  \n (c) Qualification pay.  \n (d) Disturbance Pay.  \n 5.  The word ‗pension' wherever used in these orders means pension before \ncommutation and/or surrender.  \n 6.

It is clarified that these allowances are not \nadmissible during re -employment/c ontractual appointment because: — \n (1) 100% Orderly Allowance is already included in pension, as Special \nAdditional Pens ion. \n (2) Similarly, Senior Post Allowance also forms part of pension. Moveover, this \nallowance is admissible to civil servants: whereas a contractual appointee is \nnot a civil servant.  \n (3) Qualification Pay also forms part of pension. This has been examin ed many \ntimes in the past. The view has been:  \n   ―QP is not admissible because, the philosophy at the time of its introduction \nwas to encourage the government officers in service to do the higher courses \nand was made a condition for future promotion. It was meant as an incentive \nfor government's regular, permanent officers who are in service. Moreover, \nthe Qualification Pay is counted towa rds pension. As such, there can not be \ntwo benefits at the same time, as the officer was already drawing. ‖ \n    Page - 928                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                 CHAPTER -9 \n \n  2.  If thes e allowances are again granted on re -employment, it will amount to \nduplication.

TERMINATION OF SERVICES  \n 8.1 C.S.R. 436. Notice of Discharge on the  \nAbolition of Post to Permanent Empl oyees  \n Reasonable notice should be given to an officer in permanent employ before his \nservices are dispensed with on the abolition of his office. If, in any case, notice of at least \nthree months is not given, and the officer has not been provided with othe r employment \non the date on which his services are dispensed with, then, with the sanction of the \nauthority competent to dispense with the officer's services, a gratuity not exceeding his \nemoluments for the period by which the notice actually given to him falls short of three \nmonths, may be paid to him, in addition to the pension to which he may be entitled under \nthese regulations; but the pension shall not be payable for the period in respect of which \nhe receives a gratuity in lieu of notice.  \n 1. The grat uity prescribed in this Article is not granted as compensation for \nloss of employment but only in lieu of notice of discharge with a view to mitigating the \nhardship caused an officer by the sudden loss of employment.  When, therefore, an \nofficer discharged  without notice is provided with some other employment on the date on \nwhich his services are dispensed with whether that re -employment be in qualifying or \nnon-qualifying service, he is not entitled to any gratuity.  \n 2. Unless it contains an express stateme nt to the contrary, an order for the \nabolition of an office or appointment shall not be brought into operation till the expiry of \nthree months after notice has been given to the officers whose services are to be \ndispensed with on such abolition.  The immed iate head of the office or the department \nwill be held responsible that there is no necessary delay in giving such notice.  In the case \nof an officer on leave, the order shall not be brought into operation until the leave expires.  \n Note. —‖Emoluments ‖ in this rule means the emoluments or leave allowances \n(or partly the one, partly the other) which the officer would be receiving during the period \nin question had the notice not been given to him.  \n CSR 436 -A.  Whenever it is found necessary to determine t he service of an \nofficer serving under a contract within the period of his agreement, a specific intimation \nof the determination of the agreement and of the grounds on which it has been \ndetermined shall be furnished to the officer in writing.  \n \n                                                           \n Added vide Finance Division‘s Notification No. D.203 -RSII/69, dated 24 -02-1969.  \n    Page - 934                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                 CHAPTER -9 \n \n  8.2 Termina tion of Service of Temporary  \nGovernment Servants  \n A civil servant is not necessarily in temporary employment merely because of a \nstatement in the order of appointment that his appointment will be purely temporary and \nliable to termination at any time without any notice or reasons being assigned.  No civil \nservant is a temporary employee as long as the employment is for an indefinite period or \nagainst a post which continues to exist for an indefinite period.  It is extremely difficult to \nattribute to th e legislature an intention to clothe the authorities concerned with arbitrary \npowers of terminating the services of a civil servant in their discretion without assigning \nany reason.  The courts have always been reluctant to interpret these provisions in a \nmanner as would justify the externment of an employee without any justification.  \n 2. Further, after the enactment of Civil Servants Act, 1973, the services of a \ncivil servant can either be terminated under Section 11 of the Act or under Government \nServant s (E&D) Rules, 1973.  It is not possible to spell out any power to terminate the \nservices of an employee without notice and without assigning any reason from the provision \nof sub section (3) of Section 11 of Civil Servants Act, 1973, especially in the pres ence of the \nprovisions of sub -section (1) thereof regarding termination of service during the initial or \nextended period of probation.  If an employee has passed through the period of probation to \nthe satisfaction of the competent authority, he is no longe r a temporary employee within the \nmeanings of sub -section (3) if his employment is for an indefinite period or against a post \nwhich continues to exist for an indefinite period.  \n 3. In the light of the above advice of the Justice Division services of an emp loyee \ncan no more be terminated without notice and without assigning reason.  \n[Authority. - Extract from Estt.

All concerned are, therefore, requested to keep in view the above decision \nwhen appointing an officer on contract and to stipulate in the agreemen t that the services \nof the officer employed on contract may be terminated on 3 month's notice on either side \neven before expiry of the period of the contract.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

If the Audit Officer \nfeels any doubt about the intention under lying the orders of the punishing authority, he \nhas simply to ascertain it and act accordingly.  \n[Authority. - Auditor General's letter U.O.

Division‘s O.M.

This \ndefeats the purpose of horizontal movement which was envisaged under the \nAdministrative Reforms to ensure a fair representation of officers with varied experience \nat policy making levels in the Federal Government. It has, therefore, been decided that \nofficers ‗inducted into an Occupational Group with their consent, will not in future be \nallowed to opt out.  \n 2. However, officers of the Secretariat Group can be posted to other groups \nfor exigencies of service and in public interest.  \n[Authority. — Estt. Division‘s O.M.

It has been decided that reversion should be made in the reverse order of ad \nhoc appointments.  However, when the date of ad hoc appointment of more than one \nofficer is one and the same, the reversion should be made in the reverse order of the \nseniority in the lower BPS if available, otherwise the younger in age should revert first.  \nReversion, for the purposes of this O.M., includes termination of service where the ad \nhoc appointee was recruited directly from outside.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division‘s O.M. No.1/8/72 -DIII, dated 4 -5-1972].  \n 9.5 Departmental Promotion Committee not  \nConcerned with Demotions/ Reversions  \n It appears from references made recently to the Establishment Division that the \nscope and functions of Departmental Promotion Committees are not clearly understood.  In \ncertain cases, government servants off iciating w ithout any condition in higher grades have \nbeen demoted on the recommendation of Departmental Promotion Committees.  It is \nnecessary, therefore, that the position should be clarified.  \n 2. As their name indicates, the function of Departmental Promotion Comm ittee \nis to make recommendations in respect of promotions and there is nothing in Establishment \nDivision Office Memorandum No. 33/l/47 -Ests. (SEII), dated the 29th January, 1948 which \nrelates to the constitution of these Committees to suggest that these Co mmittees have been \ngiven the power to recommend the demotion of an officiating officer (Please see Note below).  \n 3. What Departmental Promotion Committees should do is to prepare a list \nof officers whom they consider fit for promotion.  They should revise this list \nperiodically which means that they can either add to, or subtract from it. An officer who \nhas been substantively promoted to a higher BPS will not, of course, figure in this list.  \nSimilarly, an officer who has been promoted to officiate in a sub stantive vacancy for an \nindefinite period should not appear in the list because he is for all practical purposes to \ncontinue in the higher BPS. In other words, the officers whose names will be shown in \nthe list maintained by these Committees will be those who have not been promoted to a \nhigher BPS in any capacity or who have officiated off and on or who are officiating \nagainst leave vacancies or in temporary posts of short duration and are, therefore, liable \nto revert in the normal course to the lower grade . \n[Authority. - Cabinet Secretariat, Estt.

RESIGNATION FROM GOVERNMENT SERVICE  \n 10.1  Acceptance of Resignation During  \n  Pendency of Disciplinary Proceedings  \n The instructions containe d in the Establishment Division Office Memorandum No. \n5/3-A/52 -ME, dated the 6th January, 1953 (Annex) can be interpreted to mean that the \nresignation of a government servant, whose conduct is under enquiry, can be accepted and \nthe orders of dismissal or d ischarge can be passed in due course. The legal position, \nhowever, is that any orders of dismissal or discharge passed after retirement or resignation \nwill be void, and inoperative on the ground that the person concerned does not remain in \nservice as soon as his resignation has been accepted. The instructions contained in the \nOffice Memorandum, dated the 6th January, 1953 (Annex) have, therefore, been considered \nfurther by the Establishment Division in consultation with the Ministry of Law and the \nfollowing  clarification is issued for the guidance of the Ministries, etc: - \n(a) Service of a temporary government servant who has signed the undertaking \ncan be terminated by the government on 14 days' notice.  \n(b) If such a government servant wants to terminate his employment, he \nshould submit his resignation.  \n(c) The employer may or may not accept his resignation.  \n(d) If his resignation is not accepted on any ground, including the ground of \ndisciplinary action outstanding against him, he continues to be in service \ninspite of his having given 14 days' notice of his intention to do so.  \n(e)  He should not absent himself from office without leave.  \n(f) If his resignation is accepted, he does not continue his service, and his \npresence in office should not be insisted upon.  \n(g) In the event of his resignation having been accepted the disciplinary action \nstanding against him, should not be proceeded with as he cannot be \npunished for the reason that he does not continue in service.  \n(h) The undertaking prescribed for temporary employees does not reserve any \nright in a temporary government servant to terminate his employment by \nmere notice.  He has to resign his post on the expiry of the notice and the \nresignation does not become effective unless it is accepted by \nGovernment.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division‘s O.M.

It has been decided, in consultation with the Ministry of Law, that if such a \n    Page - 938                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021)                                 CHAPTER -9 \n \n governme nt servant gives the prescribed notice of his intention to resign or forfeit his pay \nto the President in lieu thereof, his continuance in service should not be insisted upon.  \nThe person concerned should, therefore, be relieved of his duties but the depart mental \nproceedings against him may be continued if considered necessary and formal orders \npassed.  \n 10.2 Withdrawal of Resignation by  \nGovernment Servants  \n The question whether resignation once tendered by a government servant before \ncompletion of 25 years  qualifying service may be allowed to be withdrawn before or after \nits acceptance by the competent authority has been under consideration in the \nEstablishment Division.  \n 2. The following decisions have been taken in consultation with the Ministry \nof Financ e:- \n(i) Withdrawal of resignation before acceptance. -In case a government \nservant withdraws resignation before it is accepted by the competent \nauthority, the resignation should be deemed to have been withdrawn.  \n(ii) Withdrawal of resignation after its acce ptance but before it becomes effective \n(i.e. before the government servant concerned is relieved). —It should be open \nto the authority accepting the resignation to allow the government servant \nconcerned to withdraw the resignation on the merits of the case.  \n [Authority. - Estt.

This requires a reference back to the Min istries/Divisions for obtaining \nthe letter of resignation. All Ministries/Divisions are, therefore, requested to please \nensure that the letter of resignation of the officer in original invariably forwarded \nalongwith the Summary for acceptance by the compet ent authority.  \n 2. Besides, the Summary should contain information on the following points: - \n(i) Whether any dues are recoverable from the officer.  \n(ii) Whether any disciplinary proceedings are pending or are contemplated \nagainst him.  \n                                                           \n*With the delegation of powers of appointment to Secretaries of Ministries/Divisions/Head of Department \nexcept those Groups/Service administratively controlled by the Establishment Division in respect of civil \nservants in BPS 17 & 19, the position has changed.

Cases have come to the notice of the \nEstablishment Division in which a civil servant, who intends to resign from service, gives \n14 days' notice or deposits 14 days' pay in lieu thereof. After expiry of the notice period \nor having deposited 14 days' pay in lieu thereof, and he absents himself from office \nwithout waiting for acceptance of his resignation. This is against the rules. There is no \nprovision in the Civil Servants Act, 1973, whereunder a civil servant whether permanent \nor temporary who wants to terminate his employment is required to give or can give 14 \ndays' notice or forfeit his pay to government in li eu thereof.  \n 2.  A civil servant, permanent or temporary, who wishes to terminate his \nappointment, should, submit his resignation in writing. The resignation shall not become \neffective unless it is accepted by the competent authority. Till such time the re signation is \naccepted, the civil servant concerned continues to be in service and cannot absent himself \nfrom his duties without proper leave. The position in this regard is already explained in the \nEstablishment Division's O.M. No. 1/34/57 -MS, dated the 12th November, 1957, read with \nO.M. of even number dated the 9th May, 1958.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

No.1/11/80 -D.I, dated \nthe 13th February, 1980. It is stated that inspite of instructions contained therein, the \nMinistries/Divisions have been sending proposals for acceptance of resignation of \nofficers to the Establishment Division which are not self -contained. The proposals are \nneither sent in the form of a Summary nor are accompanied by the original letter of \nresignation of the officer. A number of such references also do not give the information \nas required in para 2 of the aforesaid O.M. This requires back reference to the \nMinistry/Division concerned causing delay in the disposal of the case.  The Ministries/ \nDivisions are, therefore, requested to submit, in future, the cases of resignation strictly in \naccordance with the instructions contained in the E stablishment Division's O.M. quoted \nabove and may also keep in view the orders contained in O.M.

If a person has submitted resignation from service he \ncontinues to be in service, inspite of his having given 14 days notice, till his resignation is \naccepted by the competent authority. If he absents himse lf from duty he is liable to be \nproceeded against under the Efficiency and Discipline Rules, 1973 which may also result in \ndismissal from government service.  \n 2. Ministries/Divisions are, therefore, requested to forward the cases for \nacceptance of resignation to the Establishment Division well in time and should not \nrelieve the resigning officer from his duties till his resignation from service is accepted by \nthe competent authority.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division‘s O.M. No. 15/6/85 -R.2 dated 3 -3-1986] . \n 10.7 Absence from Duty Without Leave  \n Cases have come to notice where government servants have applied for leave, \nbut before the leave was sanctioned, have absented themselves from duty and left their \nstation without permission, while government dues w ere payable by them on various \naccounts.  In some cases, government servants have proceeded on short leave, and \nsubsequently applied for extension of leave, which was not granted, whereupon they have \nresigned their appointments without clearing the governm ent dues outstanding against \nthem.  Such behaviour on the part of government servants is not only undesirable but also \ncontravenes the provisions of the Pakistan Essential Service (Maintenance) Act, 1952, \nwhich makes all employment under government an esse ntial service.  If any government \nservant, without reasonable excuse, abandons his employment or absents himself from \nwork, he is liable to conviction to be punished with imprisonment and fine vide section 5 \nand 7 of the Act.  \n 2. It is, therefore, requeste d that the attention of all government servants may \nkindly be drawn to the provisions of the Act and they may be warned that any \ncontravention of the Act renders them liable to prosecution.  A number of prosecutions \nhave already been instituted in the cour t and others are in contemplation.  \n[Authority. - Estt. Division‘s O.M.

An implication of \nthese instructions is that joint representations cannot be made to the government.  It has \nbeen observed that some government servants have submitted representations in \ncontravention of th e spirit of these instructions in that they have individually signed \ncopies of petitions containing the same text. Government is of the view that although \nthese petitions are signed and sent separately, they are , in effect , tantamount to joint \nrepresentati ons. No action can, therefore, be taken on such representations.  \n 2. The correct procedure is that , if any category of government servants have \na grievance of a common nature, they should bring the matter to the notice of the head of \nthe department concern ed so that he may take such action , as may be necessary in the \ncircumstances of the case.  \n 3. Ministries/Divisions are requested to advise officers and members of the \nstaff under their control to keep these instructions in mind while making representations  \nin respect of a common grievance. As joint representations are not permitted, a breach of \nthese instructions will amount to an act of indiscipline.  \n[Authority .- Estt.

While this may well be within the existing rules, it is not in \nharmony with demands of a democratic order as it infringes upon the privilege of Prime \nMinister's Secretariat to forward grievances and requests to the quarters concerned for \naction and redressal under the directives of the Prime Minister as, indeed, it takes away , \nfrom the civil servants an opportunity of access to the Chief Executive of the country \nthrough the quic kest means possible.  \n 2.

As per provisions of rule 8(I) of the Civil Servants (Appeal) Rules, 1977, \nan appeal which is not withheld under rule 7, is required to be forwarded to the appellate \nauthority with an expression of opinion by the authority in the form of a speaking order \nforegoing his prerogative to withhold the appeal. Moreover, it would not be fair and \nproper to submit such cases to the appellate authority for rejection which could ha ve been \nwithheld by the authority. An appeal which is not entertainable, if transmitted to and rejected by \nthe appellate authority, would clearly mean that the appeal has been entertained.  \n 3. All Ministries/Divisions are to exercise greatest care while tr ansmitting \nappeals to the appellate authority under rule 3 of the Civil Servants (Appeal) Rules, 1977. \nThe appellant should be informed accordingly where appeal is withheld under rule 7 of \nthe Civil Servants (Appeal) Rules, 1977.  \n[Authority :- Estab.

It has been noticed that the Ministries/  \nDivisions etc. do not deal with such cases on the plea that the government servants have \nfiled suits and the matter is ‗subjudice ‘. \n 2. A civil suit or a civil petition by a government servant does not preclude \nredress for the aggrieved government servant.  It has, therefore, been decided that the \nMinistries/Divisions should not refrain from considering the cases of government servants \nwho have filed civil suits against government fo r redress of their grievances. Cases of such \ngovernment servants should continue to be considered by the Ministries/Divisions and the \ngrievances of the government servants removed if the merits of their cases so warrant.  \n[Authority. - Estt.

In \ncases where Writ Petitions/Civil Suits are filed, they should be con tested \non the point of jurisdiction.  \n(ii) In Appeals/Writ Petitions/Civil Suits against orders passed by the \nMinistries/Divisions, the responsibility of defending such cases      is of the \nMinistry / Division / Attached Department concerned. However, in view of  \nthe fact that Establishment Division is made proforma party in most of the \ncases, the cases are referred routinely to Establishment Division which \nresults in loss of time. It is clarified that where the final orders have been \npassed by the Ministry/ Divis ion other than the Establishment Division no \nreference should be made to the Establishment Division unless there is a \nspecific point of reference, in which case the issue should be clearly \nspecified and necessary papers supplied as annex in a self containe d \nreference. It would not be possible for the Establishment Division to \nrespond to general queries or a general request for advice in such cases.  \n(iii) In cases where the Ministries/Divisions are the principal respondent, \narrangement for submission of parawise c omments well in time and \nappointment of counsels to defend the case should be made in consultation \nwith the Law Division.  The Federal Service Tribunal is presently not \nhappy about the delays in filing parawise comments and the proper defence  \nof the cases before them by the Ministries/ Divisions.  \n[(iii-a) The government departments should assure that no case goes \nunrepresented before any court/tribunal. A responsible officer well \nconversant with the case, alongwith government counsel should always be \ndeput ed to represent the government and assist the court/tribunal on the \nbasis of departmental record and the policy stand taken in the case.]   \n(iv) In defending the appeals before the Service Tribunals, the question of \nlimitation should be carefully examined, and the appeals contested on this \nground where appeals are time barred.  \n(v) The Ministries/Divisions are also required to examine those cases which \nare decided against the government by the Service Tribunal in their \ncapacity as the main respondent, with a view to filing an appeal before the \nSupreme Court in consultation with the Law Division directly. Such cases \nneed not to be referred to this Division for examination.  \n[(vi) In case it is decided, in consultation with the Law and Justice Division, \nthat an order p assed by the Tribunal does not involve any substantial \nquestion of law of public importance for moving a CPSLA before the \n                         \n Inserted vide per Establishment Division‘s O.M No. 1/1/95 -Lit.2/Misc. dated 30 -08-1995 read with O.M No. \n2/19/93 -Lit.3, date d 28 -05-1994 and O.M No. 1/23/94 -Lit.2, dated 03 -11-1994.

The Prime Minster has desired that all \nlegal remedies be exhausted in cases of service matter litigations as any \ninterim decision becomes precedent for all future cases.   \n[Authority .- Estt. Division‘s O.M. No. 14/5/80 -Lit. Misc., dated 7 -3-1982]. \n Note. - For detailed instructions regarding the conduct of cases of the Federal Government in \ncourts (including service appeals before the Service Tribunal), see Appendix ‘F ’ of the \nSecretariat Instructions (2004 Edition Pages 119 -129).  \n 6.2 Letter of  Attorney General of Pakistan Regarding Implementation  \n  of Orders of the Federal Service Tribunal and H igh Courts Appealed  \n  Against in Supreme Court of Pakistan  \nIt has been observed that orders passed in service matters by the Federal Service \nTribunal d ecided against the government are not implemented as per directions given in \nthe respective orders. The government departments postpone the implementation of the \norders of the Federal Service Tribunal on the grounds that CPLA is preferred against the \norder  and wait for the disposal of the matter by the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan. \nThe government departments are hereby informed that unless the order of FST is \nsuspended specifically by an order of the Supreme Court, the same must be implemented \nforthw ith. However, a clause may be added in the implementation orders that it shall be \nsubject to the final decision of the matter by the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan. \nThis eventuality of informing the government departments has arisen because recently t he \nHonorable Supreme Court of Pakistan has started taking a very serious note of this fact \nand in some of the cases, heavy costs up to Rs. 50,000/ - has been imposed by the \nHonorable Supreme Court of Pakistan simply for the reason that the government \ndepart ment has not implemented the orders during the pendency of the CPLA, without \nthere being any order of suspension of the orders appealed against. The matter must be \nattended to urgently in order to avoid any further financial loss to the national exchequer.  \nThus all the matters which are decided by the FST or which are pending in the Honorable \nSupreme Court of Pakistan or which may be instituted before the Honorable Supreme \nCourt of Pakistan against any order passed by the FST, directing the reinstatement or  \ngranting some other relief to a civil servant, be complied with forthwith, unless the order \nappealed against is specifically suspended by the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan.  \n 2. The Secretary Establishment is further requested to convey this message to \nall the departments concerned of the government in respect of which the service matters \ncrop up before the FST or before the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan for necessary \naction.  \n[Authority: - Office of the Attorney General for Pakistan's DO No. 1(5) 2006 -AGP,  dated 2 -3-2006]  \n                         \n Inserted vide Establishment Division‘s O.M No. F.2/9/2016 -Lit.I, dated 24 -05-2016.  \nCHAPTER -10                        ESTACODE  (EDITION -2021 )                                 Page- 971 \n \n  6.3 Letter of Chairman FST Making Suggestions  \nto Reduce Pending Litigation  \n The worthy Chairman, Federal Service Tribunal vide his d.o letter dated 26th \nJuly,2019  (Copy not reproduced)  has invited attention of Secretary Establish ment Division \nto the following: — \n Decisions on appeal are delayed for want of parawise comments  from  \nMinistries/Division s; \n Government departments are not represented at appropriate higher  level;  \n Implementation of judgments/Decision s is subjected to unreaso nable delay  \nby Ministries/Divisions.  \n2. The worthy Chairman has, therefore, suggested that a ‗Special Cell‘ may be \ncreated in all Ministries/Divisions at the appropriate level to keep the Establishment Division  \ninformed on regular basis about pendency or disposal of the appeals in the Tribunal.  \n3. Instructions of the Establishment Division are already available in \nESTACODE 2015 at pages 1047 to 1051, emphasizing timely s ubmission of parawise \ncomments, projection of the Government viewpoint through respons ible officers and \nimplementation of the judgments that attained finality or not suspended/set aside by the \nSupreme Court. These instructions are in addition to Appendix -F to Secretariat Instructions.  \n4. Ministries/Divisions are requested to strictly obser ve the instructions already \nholding the field and may also strengthen their own mechanisms to watch progress of Court \ncases in the light of Paragraph 12 of Appendix -F to Secretariat Instructions which inter alia  \nprovides that, — \n ―It is, therefore, imperati ve that in each Division/Department, a Section, \nhereinafter referred to as the Litigation Section, should be earmarked for dealing \nwith or co -ordinating the litigation cases.
