Every person of sound mind not being a minor may \ndispose of his property by will.  \n \n Expla nation 1.― A married woman may dispose by will of any property which she could \nalienate by her own act during her life.  \n \n Explanation 2.___Persons who are deaf or dumb or blind are not thereby incapacitated for \nmaking a will if they are able to know what they do by it.  \n \n Explanation . 3.___ A person who is ordinarily insane may make a will during interval in \nwhich he is of sound mind.  \n  \n Explanation  4.___ No person can make a will while he is in such a state of mind, whether \narising from intoxication or f rom illness or from any other cause, that he does not know what he is \ndoing.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A can perceive what is going on in his immediate neighbourhood, and can \nanswer familiar questions, but has not a competent understanding as to the \nnature of h is property, or the persons who are of kindred to him, or in whose \nfavour it would be proper that he should make his will. A cannot make a valid \nwill. \n  \n(ii)  A executes an instrument purporting to be his will, but he does not understand \nthe nature of the instrument, nor the effect of its provisions. This instrument is \nnot a valid will.  \n  \n(iii)  A, being very feeble and debilitated, but capable of exercising a judgment as \nto the proper mode of disposing of his property, makes a will. This is  a valid \nwill. \n \n 60. Testamentary guardian.  A father, whatever his age may be, may by will appoint a \nguardian or guardians  for his child during minority.  \n \n 61. Will obtained by fraud, coercion or importunity.  A will or any part of a will, the \nmaking of which has been caus ed by fraud or coercion, or by such importunity as takes away the free \nagency of the testator, is void.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A falsely and knowingly represents to the testator that the testator ’s only child \nis dead, or that he has done some undutiful act a nd thereby induces the testator \nto make a will in his, A ’s, favour; such will has been obtained by fraud, and is \ninvalid.  \n  \n(ii)  A, by fraud and deception, prevails upon the testator to bequeath a legacy to \nhim. The bequest is void.   \n \nPage 37 of 133 \n (iii)  A, being a p risoner by lawful authority, makes his will. The will is not invalid \nby reason of the imprisonment.  \n  \n(iv)  A threatens to shoot B, or to burn his house or to cause him to be arrested on a \ncriminal charge, unless he makes a bequest in favour of C. B, in c onsequence, \nmakes a bequest in favour of C. The bequest is void, the making of it having \nbeen caused by coercion.  \n  \n(v)  A, being of sufficient intellect, if undisturbed by the influence of others, to \nmake a will yet being so much under the control of B t hat he is not a free \nagent, makes a will, dictated by B. It appears that he would not have executed \nthe will but for fear of B. The will is invalid.  \n  \n(vi)  A, being in so feeble a state of health as to be unable to resist importunity, is \npressed by B to make a will of a certain purport and does so merely to \npurchase peace and in submission to B. The will is invalid.  \n  \n(vii)  A being in such a state of health as to be capable of exercising his own \njudgment and volition, B uses urgent intercession and pers uasion with him \nto induce him  to make a will of a certain purport. A, in consequence of the \nintercession and persuasion, but in the free exercise of his judgment and \nvolition makes his will in the manner recommended by B. The will is not \nrendered invalid b y the intercession and persuasion of B.  \n  \n(viii)  A, with a view to obtaining a legacy from B, pays him attention and flatters \nhim and thereby produces in him a capricious partiality to A. B, in \nconsequence of such attention and flattery, makes his will, by which he leaves \na legacy to A. The bequest is not rendered invalid by the attention and flattery \nof A.  \n \n 62. Will may be revoked or altered.  A will is liable to be revoked or altered by the maker of \nit at any time when he is competent to dispose of his  property by will.  \n____  \n \nCHAPTER III  \n \nOF THE EXECUTION OF  UNPRIVILEGED  WILLS  \n \n 63.

Every testator, not being a soldier employed in an \nexpedition or engaged in actual warfare, 1[or an airman so employed or engaged,] or a ma riner at sea, \nshall execute his will according to the following rules:___  \n  \n(a) The testator shall sign or shall affix his mark to the will, or it shall be signed \nby some other person in his presence and by his direction.  \n  \n(b) The signature or mark of th e testator, or the signature of the person signing for \nhim, shall be so placed that it shall appear that it was intended thereby to give \neffect to the writing as a will.  \n \n \n \n1Ins. by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1927 (10 of 1927), s. 2 and 1st Sch. \n \nPage 38 of 133 \n (c) The will shall be attested by two or more witnesses, each of whom has seen \nthe testator sign or affix his mark to the will or has seen some other person \nsign the will, in the presence and by the direction of the testator, or has \nreceived from the testator a  personal acknowledgment of his signature or \nmark, or of the signature of such other person ; and each of the witnesses shall \nsign the will in the presence of the testator, but it shall not be necessary that \nmore than one witness be present at the same tim e, and no particular form of \nattestation shall be necessary.  \n \n 64. Incorporation of papers by reference . If a testator, in a will or codicil duly attested, \nrefers to any other document then actually written as expressing any part of his intentions, such \ndocument shall be deemed to form a part of the will or codicil in which it is referred to.  \n_____  \n \nCHAPTER IV  \n \nOF PRIVILEGED  WILLS  \n \n 65. Privileged wills.  Any soldier being employed in an expedition or engaged in actual \nwarfare, 1[or an airman so employed or  engaged,] or any mariner being at sea, may, if he has \ncompleted the age of eighteen years, dispose of his property by a will made in the manner provided \nin section 66. Such wills are called privileged wills.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A, a medical officer attac hed to a regiment, is actually employed in an \nexpedition. He is a soldier actually employed in an expedition, and can make a \nprivileged will.  \n \n(ii)  A is at sea in a merchant - ship, of which he is the purser. He is a mariner, and, \nbeing at sea, can make a privileged will.  \n  \n(iii)  A, a soldier serving in the field against insurgents, is a soldier engaged in \nactual warfare, and as s uch can make a privileged will.  \n \n(iv)  A, a mariner of a ship, in the course of a voyage, is temporarily on shore while \nshe is l ying in harbour. He is,  for the purposes of this section, a mariner at sea, \nand can make a privileged will.  \n \n (v)  A, an admiral who commands a naval force, but who lives on shore, and only \noccasionally goes on board his ship, is not considered as at  sea, and cannot \nmake a privileged will.  \n \n(vi)  A, a mariner serving on a military expedition, but not being at sea, is \nconsidered as a soldier, and can make a privileged will.  \n \n 66. Mode of making, and rules for executing, privileged wills .― (1) Privileged wills may \nbe in writing, or may be made by word of mouth.  \n \n \n1Ins. by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1927 (10 of 1927), s. 2 and 1st Sch. \n \nPage 39 of 133 \n  (2) The execution of privileged wills shall be governed by the following rules: ― \n \n(a) The will may b e written wholly by the testator, with his own hand. In such \ncase it need not be signed or attested.  \n \n(b) It may be written wholly or in part by another person, and signed by the \ntestator. In such case it need not be attested.  \n  \n(c) If the instrument purp orting to be a will is written wholly or in part by another \nperson and is not signed by the testator, it shall be deemed to be his will, if it is \nshown that it was written by the testator ’s directions or tha t he recognised it as \nhis will.  \n \n(d) If it appear s on the face of the instrument that the execution of it in the manner \nintended by the testator was not completed, the instrument shall not, by  reason of \nthat circumstance, be invalid, provided that his non -execution of it can be \nreasonably ascribed to som e cause other than the abandonment of the \ntestamentary intentions expressed in the instrument.  \n \n(e) If the soldier, 1[airman] or mariner has written instructions for the preparation \nof his will, but has died before it could be prepared and executed, such \ninstructions shall be considered to constitute his will.  \n \n(f) If the soldier, 1[airman] or mariner has, in the presence of two witnesses, given \nverbal instructions for the preparation of his will, and they have been reduced \ninto writing in his lifetime, but  he has died before the instrument could be \nprepared and executed, such instructions shall be considered to constitute his \nwill, although they may not have been reduced into writing in his presence, \nnor read over to him.  \n \n(g) The soldier, 1[airman] or mari ner may make a will by word of mouth by \ndeclaring his intentions before two witnesses present at the same time.  \n  \n(h) A will made by word of mouth shall be null at the expiration of one month \nafter the testator, being still alive, has ceased to be entitled  to make a \nprivileged will.  \n____  \n \n \nCHAPTER V  \n \nOF THE ATTESTATION, REVOCATION, ALTERATION AND REVIVAL OF WILLS.  \n \n 67. Effect of gift to attesting witness.  A will shall not be deemed to be insufficiently attested \nby reason of any benefit thereby given eithe r by way of bequest or by way of appointment to any \nperson attesting it, or to his or her wife or husband; but the bequest or appointment shall be void so \nfar as concerns the person so attesting, or the wife or husband of such person, or any person claimin g \nunder either of them.    \n \n \n \n1Ins. by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1927 (10 of 1927), s. 2 and 1st Sch. \n \nPage 40 of 133 \n  Explanation .___ A legatee under a will does not lose his legacy by attesting a c odicil which \nconfirms the will.  \n \n 68. Witness not disqualified by in terest or by being executor.  No person, by reason of \ninterest in, or of his being an executor of, a will, shall be disqualified as a witness to prove the \nexecution of the will or to prove the validity or invalidity thereof.  \n \n 69. Revocation of will by test ator’s marriage.  Every will shall be revoked by the marriage \nof the maker, except a will made in exercise of a power of appointment, when the property over \nwhich the power of appointment is exercised would not, in default of such appointment, pass to his \nor her executor or administrator, or to the person entitled in case of intestacy.  \n \n Explanation.___ Where a man is invested with power to determine the disposition of property \nof which he is not the owner, he is said to have power to appoint such property.  \n \n 70. Revocation of unprivileged will or codicil.  No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part \nthereof, shall be revoked otherwise than by marriage, or by another will or codicil, or by some \nwriting declaring an intention to revoke the same and executed in the manner in which an \nunprivileged will is hereinbefore required to be executed, or by the burning, tearing or otherwise \ndestroying the same by the testator or by some person in his presence and by his direction with the \nintention of revoking the same.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A has made an unprivileged will. Afterwards, A makes another unprivileged \nwill which purports to revoke the first. This is a revocation.  \n \n(ii)  A has made an unprivileged will. Afterwards, A, being entitled to make a \nprivileged will,  makes a privileged will, which purports to revoke his \nunprivile ged will. This is a revocation.  \n \n 71. Effect of obliteration, interlineation or alteration in unprivileged will . No \nobliteration, interlineation or other alteration made in any unprivileged wi ll after the execution \nthereof shall have any effect, except so far as the words or meaning of the will have been thereby \nrendered illegible or undiscernible, unless such alteration has been executed in like manner as \nhereinbefore is required for the execu tion of the will:  \n  \n Provided that the will, as so altered, shall be deemed to be duly executed if the signature of \nthe testator and the subscription of the witnesses is made in the margin or on some other part of the \nwill opposite or near to such alterati on, or at the foot or end of or opposite to a memorandum \nreferring to such alteration, and written at the end or some other part of the will.  \n \n 72. Revocation of privileged will or codicil.  A privileged will or codicil may be revoked by \nthe testator by an  unprivileged will or codicil, or by any act expressing an intention to revoke it and \naccompanied by such formalities as would be sufficient to give validity to a privileged will, or by the \nburning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator,  or by some person in his presence \nand by his direction, with the intention of revoking the same.  \n \n Explanation .―In order to the revocation of a privileged will or codicil by an act \naccompanied by such formalities as would be sufficient to give validity to a privileged will, it is not \n \nPage 41 of 133 \n necessary that the testator should at the time of doing that act be in a situation  which entitles him to \nmake a privileged will.  \n  \n 73. Revival of unprivileged will .―(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, \nwhich has been revoked in any manner, shall be re vived otherwise than by the re -execution thereof, \nor by a codici l executed in manner hereinbefore required, and showing an intention to revive the \nsame.  \n \n (2) When any will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, \nis revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation \nof the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the will or codicil.  \n____  \n \n \nCHAPTER VI  \n \nOF THE CONSTRUCTION OF WILLS  \n \n 74. Wording of will.  It is not necessary that any technical words or terms of ar t be used in a \nwill, but only that the wording be such that the intentions of the testator can be known therefrom.  \n  \n 75. Inquiries to determine questions as to object or subject of will . For the purpose of \ndetermining questions as to what person or what p roperty is denoted by any words used in a will, a \nCourt shall inquire into every material fact relating to the persons who claim to be interested under \nsuch will, the property which is claimed as the subject of disposition, the circumstances of the \ntestato r and of his family, and into every fact a knowledge of which may conduce to the right \napplication of the words which the testator has used.  \n  \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A, by his will, bequeaths 1, 000 rupees to his eldest son or to his youngest \ngrandchild, or t o his cousin, Mary. A Court may make inquiry in order to \nascertain to what person the d escription in the will applies.  \n \n(ii)  A, by his will, leaves to B “my estate called Black Acre”. It may be necessary \nto take evidenc e in order to ascertain what is the subject -matter of the bequest; \nthat is to say, what estate of the testator ’s is called Black Acre.  \n  \n(iii)  A, by his will, leaves to B “the estate which I purchased of C”. It may be \nnecessary to take evidence in order to ascertain what estate the testator  \npurchased of C.  \n \n 76. Misnomer or misdescription of object .―(1) Where the words used in a will to \ndesignate or describe a legatee or a class of legatees sufficiently show what is meant, an error in the \nname or description shall not prevent the legacy from taking effect.  \n  \n (2) A mistake in the name of a legatee ma y be corrected by a description of him, and a \nmistake in the description of a legatee may be corrected by the name.  \n \n \nPage 42 of 133 \n Illustrations  \n  \n(i)  A bequeaths a legacy to “Thomas, the second son of my brother John”. The \ntestator has an only brother named John, wh o has no son named Thomas, but \nhas a second son whose name is William. William will have the legacy.  \n  \n(ii)  A bequeaths a legacy “to Thomas, the second son of my brother John”. The \ntestator has an only brother, named John, whose first son is named  Thoma s \nand whose second son is named William. Thomas will have the legacy.  \n \n(iii)  The testator bequeaths his property “to A and B, the legitimate children of C”. \nC has no legitimate child, but has two illegitimate children, A and B. The \nbequest to A and B tak es effect, although they are illegitimate.  \n \n(iv)  The testator gives his residuary estate to be divided among “my seven \nchildren” and, proceeding to enumerate them, mentions six names  only.  This \nomission will not prevent the seventh child from taking a share with the \nothers.  \n \n(v)  The testator, having six grandchildren, makes a bequest to “my six \ngrandchildren” and, proceeding to mention them by their Christian  names, \nmentions one twice over omitting another altogether. The one whose name is \nnot mentione d will take a share with the others.  \n \n(vi)  The testator bequeaths “1, 000 rupees to each of the three children of A”. At \nthe date of the will A has four children. Each of these four children will, if he \nsurvives the testator, receive a legacy of 1, 000 r upees.  \n  \n 77. When words may be supplied . Where any word material to the full expression of the \nmeaning has been omitted, it may be supplied by the context.  \n  \nIllustration  \n \n The testator gives a legacy of “five hundred” to his daughter A and a legacy of “f ive hundred \nrupees” to his daughter B. A will take a legacy of five hundred rupees.  \n \n 78. Rejection of erroneous particulars in description of subject . If the thing which the \ntestator intended to bequeath can be sufficiently identified from the description  of it given in the will \nbut some parts of the description do not apply, such parts of the description shall be rejected as \nerroneous, and the bequest shall take effect.  \n  \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A bequeaths to B “my marsh -lands lying in L and in the occupatio n of X”. The \ntestator had marsh -lands lying in L but had no marsh -lands in the occupation \nof X. The words “in the occupation of X” shall be rejected as erroneous, and \nthe marsh -lands of the testator lying in L will pass by the bequest.  \n  \n(ii) The testator bequeaths to A “my zamindari of Rampur”. He had an estate at \nRampur but it was a taluq and not a zamindari. The taluq passes by this \nbequest.  \n \nPage 43 of 133 \n  79. When part of description may not be rejected as erroneous.  If a will mentions several \ncircumstances as descri ptive of the thing which the testator intends to bequeath, and there is any \nproperty of his in respect of which all those circumstances exist, the bequest shall be considered as \nlimited to such property and it shall not be lawful to reject any part of the description as erroneous, \nbecause the testator had other property to which such part of the description does not apply.  \n  \n Explanation .___ In judging whether a case falls within the meaning of this section, any words \nwhich would be liable to rejection unde r section 78 shall be deemed to have been struck out of the \nwill. \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A bequeaths to B “my marsh -lands lying in L and in the occupation of X”. The \ntestator had marsh - lands lying in L, some of which were in the occupation of \nX, and some no t in the occupation of X. The bequest will be considered as \nlimited to such of the testator ’s marsh -lands lying in L as were in the \noccupation of X.  \n \n(ii)  A bequeaths to B “my marsh -lands lying in L and in the occupation of X, \ncomprising 1, 000 bighas of lands”. The testator had marsh -lands lying in L \nsome of which were in the occupation of X and some not in the occupation of \nX. The measurement is wholly inapplicable to the marsh -lands of either class, \nor to the whole taken together. The measurement will b e considered as struck \nout of the will, and such of the testator ’s marsh -lands lying in L as were in the \noccupation of X shall alone p ass by the bequest.  \n \n 80. Extrinsic evidence admissible in cases of patent ambiguity.  Where the words of a will \nare unambi guous, but it is found by extrinsic evidence that they admit of applications, one only of \nwhich can have been intended by the testator, extrinsic evidence may be taken to show which of \nthese applications was intended.  \n  \nIllustrations  \n \n (i)  A man, having t wo cousins of the name of Mary, bequeaths a sum of \n money to “my cousin Mary”. It appears that there are two persons, \n each answering the description in the will. That description, therefore, \n admits of two applications, only one of which can have been int ended \n by the testator. Evidence is admissible to show which of the two \n applications was intended.  \n \n (ii) A, by his will, leaves to B “my estate called Sultanpur Khurd”. It turns \n out that he had two estates called Sultanpur Khurd. Evidence is \n admissibl e to show which estate was intended.  \n  \n 81. Extrinsic evidence inadmissible in case of patent ambiguity or deficiency.  Where \nthere is an ambiguity or deficiency on the face of a will, no extrinsic evidence as to the intentions of \nthe testator shall be adm itted.  \n \n \nPage 44 of 133 \n Illustrations  \n \n(i)  A man has an aunt, Caroline, and a cousin, Mary, and has no aunt of the name \nof Mary. By his will he bequeaths 1, 000 rupees to “my aunt, Caroline” and 1, \n000 rupees to “my cousin, Mary” and afterwards bequeaths 2, 000 rupees to \n“my before -mentioned aunt, Mary”. There is no person to whom the \ndescription given in the will can apply, and evidence is not admissible to show \nwho was meant by “my before -mentioned aunt, Mary”. The bequest is \ntherefore void for uncertainty under secti on 89.    \n(ii)  A bequeaths 1, 000 rupees to    leaving a blank for the name of the \nlegatee. Evidence is not admissible to show what name the testator intended to \ninsert.  \n \n(iii)  A bequeaths to B    rupees, or “my estate of”. Evidence is not \nadmissible to show  what sum or what estate t he testator intended to insert.  \n \n 82. Meaning of clause to be collected from entire will.  The meaning of any clause in a will \nis to be collected from the entire instrument, and all its parts are to be construe d with reference to \neach other.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i) The testator gives to B a specific fund or property at the death of A, and by a \nsubsequent clause gives the whole of his property to A. The effect of the \nseveral clauses taken together is to vest  the specific fund or property  in A for \nlife, and after his decease in B; it appearing from the bequest to B that the \ntestator meant to use in a restricted sense the words in which he describes what \nhe gives to A.  \n \n(ii)  Where a testator having an estate, one part of which is called B lack Acre, \nbequeaths the whole of his estate to A, and in another part of his will \nbequeaths Black Acre to B, the latter bequest is to be read as an exception out \nof the first as if he had said “I give Black Acre to B, and all the rest of my \nestate to A”.  \n \n 83. When words may be understood in restricted sense, and when in sense wider than \nusual.  General words may be understood in a restricted sense where it may be collected from the will \nthat the testator meant to use them in a restricted sense; and words may be understood in a wider \nsense than that which they usually bear, where it may be collected from the other words of the will \nthat the testator meant to use them in such wider sense.    \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A testator gives to A “my farm in the occupation  of B”, and to C “all my \nmarsh -lands in L”. Part of the farm in the occupation of B consists of marsh -\nlands in L, and the testator also has other marsh -lands in L. Thegeneral words, \n“all my marsh -lands in L,” are restricted by the gift  to A. A takes the w hole of \nthe farm in the occupation of B, including that portion of the farm which \nconsists of marsh - lands in L.  \n \n(ii)  The testator (a sailor on ship - board) bequeathed to his mother his gold ring, \nbuttons and chest of clothes, and to his friend, A (a sh ipmate), his red box, \n \nPage 45 of 133 \n clasp -knife and all th ings not before bequeathed. The testator ’s share in a \nhouse does not pass to A under this bequest.  \n  \n(iii)  A, by his will, bequeathed to B  all his household furniture, plate, linen, china, \nbooks, pictures and al l other goods of whatever kind; and afterwards \nbequeathed to B a specified part of his property. Under the first bequest, B is \nentitled only to such articles  of the testator ’s as are of the same nature with the \narticles therein enumerated.  \n  \n 84. Which of two possible constructions preferred.  Where a clause is susceptible of two \nmeanings according to one of which it has some effect, and according to the other of which it can \nhave none, the former shall be preferred.  \n  \n 85. No part rejected, if can be it rea sonably construed.  No part of a will shall be rejected \nas destitute of meaning if it is possible to put a reasonable construction upon it.  \n \n 86. Interpretation of words repeated in different parts of will.  If the same words occur in \ndifferent parts of the same will, they shall be taken to have been used everywhere in the same sense, \nunless a contrary intention appears.  \n  \n 87. Testator ’s intention to be effectuated , as far as , possible.  The intention of the testator \nshall not be set aside because it cannot t ake effect to the full extent, but effect is to be given to it as \nfar as possible.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n The testator by a will made on his death -bed bequeathed all his property to C D for life and \nafter his decease to a certain hospital. The intention of the t estator cannot take effect to its full extent, \nbecause the gift to the hospital is void under section 118, but it will take effect so far as regards the \ngift to C D.  \n \n 88. The last of two inconsistent clauses prevails.  Where two clauses of gifts in a will are \nirreconcileable, so that they cannot possibly stand together, the last shall prevail.  \n  \nIllustrations  \n \n(i) The testator by the first clause of his will leaves his estate of 1[Gujrat] “to A” , \nand by the last clause of his will leaves it “to B and not to  A”. B will have it.  \n \n(ii)  If a man, at the commencement of his will gives his house to A, and at the \nclose of it directs that his house shall be sold and the proceeds invested for the \nbenefit of B, the latter disposition will prevail.  \n \n 89. Will or bequ est void for uncertainty.  A will or bequest not expressive of any definite \nintention is void for uncertainty.  \n \n \n \n \n \n1Subs. by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration), Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s. 3, and Sch., II, for “Rangpur”. Which was previously \namended by Ord. 21 of 1960, s. 3 and 2nd Sch., for “Ramnagar” ( w.e.f. 14th October, 1955 ). \n \nPage 46 of 133 \n Illustration  \n \n If a testator says “I bequeath goods to A” , or “I bequeath to A” , or “I leave to A all the goods \nmentioned in the Schedule” and no Schedule is found, or “I bequeath ‘money ’, ‘wheat ’, ‘oil’,” or the \nlike, without saying how much, this is void.  \n \n 90. Words describing subject refer to property answering description at testator ’s \ndeath.  The description contained in a will of property, the subject of gift, shall, unless a contrary \nintention appears by the will, be deemed to refer to and comprise the property answering that \ndescription at the death of the testator.  \n \n 91. Power of appointment executed by general bequest.  Unless a contrary intention \nappears by the will, a bequest of the estate of the testator shall be construed to include any property \nwhich he may have power to appoint by will to any object he may think proper, and shall operate as \nan execution of such power; and a bequest of property described in a general manner shall be \nconstrued to include any property to which such description may extend, which he may have power \nto appoint by will to any object he may think proper, and shall operate as an execution of such \npower.  \n \n 92. Implied gift to object s of power in default of appointment.  Where property is \nbequeathed to or for the benefit of certain objects as a specified person may appoint or for the benefit  \nof certain objects in such proportions as a specified person may appoint, and the will does not  \nprovide for the event of no appointment being made; if the power given by the will is not exercised, \nthe property belongs to all the objects of the power in eq ual shares.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n A, by his will, bequeaths a fund to his wife, for her life, and dire cts that at her death it shall \nbe divided among his children in such proportions as she shall appoint. The widow dies without \nhaving made any appointment. The fund will be divided equally among the children.  \n  \n 93. Bequest to “heirs ”, etc., of particular p erson without qualifying terms.  Where a \nbequest is made to the “heirs” or “right heirs” or “relations” or “nearest relations” or “family” or \n“kindred” or “nearest of kin” or “next -of-kin” of a particular person without any qualifying terms, \nand the class s o designated forms the direct and independent object of the bequest, the property \nbequeathed shall be distributed as if it had belonged to such person and he had died intestate in \nrespect of it, leaving assets for the payment of his debts independently of such property.  \n  \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A leaves his property “to my own nearest relations”. The property goes to \nthose who would be entitled to it if A had died intestate, leaving assets for the \npayment of his debts independently of such property.  \n  \n(ii)  A bequeaths 10, 000 rupees “to B for his life, and, after the death of B, to my \nown right heirs”. The legacy after B ’s death belongs to those who would be \nentitled to it if it had formed part of A ’s unbequeathed property.  \n \n(iii)  A leaves his property to B;  but if B dies before him, to B ’s next -of-kin; B dies \nbefore A; the property devolves as if it had belonged to B, and he had died \n \nPage 47 of 133 \n intestate, leaving assets for the payment of his debts independently of such \nproperty.  \n \n(iv)  A leaves 10, 000 rupees “to B f or his life, and after his decease to the heirs of \nC”. The legacy goes as if it had belonged to C, and he had died intestate, \nleaving assets for the payment of his debts independently of the legacy.  \n \n 94. Bequest to “representatives ”, etc., of particular person.  Where a bequest is made to \nthe “representatives” or “legal representatives” or “personal representatives” or “executors or \nadministrators” of a particular person, and the class so designated forms the direct and independent \nobject of the bequest, t he property bequeathed shall be distributed as if it had belonged to such \nperson and he had died intestate in respect of it.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n A bequest is made to the “legal representatives” of A. A has died intestate and insolvent. B is \nhis administrator. B is entitled to receive the legacy, and will apply it in the first place to the \ndischarge of such part of A ’s debts as may remain unpaid: if there be any surplus B will pay it to \nthose persons who at A ’s death would have been entitled to receive any prope rty of A ’ s which might \nremain after payment of his debts, or to the representatives of such persons.  \n \n 95. Bequest without words of limitation.  Where property is bequeathed to any person, he is \nentitled to the whole interest of the testator therein, unle ss it appears from the will that only a \nrestricted interest was intended for him.  \n  \n 96. Bequest in alternative.  Where property is bequeathed to a person with a bequest in the \nalternative to another person or to a class of persons, then, if a contrary inte ntion does not appear by \nthe will, the legatee first named shall be entitled to the legacy if he is alive at the time when it takes \neffect; but if he is then dead, the person or class of persons named in the second branch of the \nalternative shall take the legacy.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A bequest is made to A or to B. A survives the testator. B takes nothing.  \n \n(ii)  A bequest is made to A or to B. A dies after the date of the will, and before the \ntestator. The legacy goes to B.  \n \n(iii)  A bequest is made to A  or to B. A is dead at the date of the will. The legacy \ngoes to B.  \n \n(iv)  Property is bequeathed to A or his heirs. A survives the testator. A  takes the \nproperty absolutely.  \n \n(v)  Property is bequeathed to A or his nearest of kin. A dies in the lifetime o f the \ntestator.

A and \nB survive the testator. B dies in A ’s lifetime. Upon A ’s death the beq uest to \nthe heirs of B takes effect.  \n  \n(vii)  Property is bequeathed to A for life, and after his death to B or his heirs. B \ndies in the testator ’s lifetime. A survives the testator. Upon A ’s death the \nbequest to the heirs of B takes effect.  \n \n 97. Effect o f words describing a class added to bequest to person.  Where property is \nbequeathed to a person, and words are added which describe a class of persons but do not denote \nthem as direct objects of a distinct and independent gift, such person is entitled to t he whole interest \nof the testator therein, unless a contrary intention appears by the will.  \n  \nIllustrations  \n \n  (i)  A bequest i s made― \n \n     A and his children,  \n to A and his children by his present wife,  \n to A and his heirs,  \n to A and the heirs of his body,  \n to A and the heirs male of his body,  \n to A and the heirs female of his body,  \n to A and his issue,  \n to A and his family,  \n to A and his descendants,  \n to A and his representatives,  \n to A and his personal representatives,  \n to A, his executors and administrators.  \n \n  In each of these cases, A takes the whole interest which the testator had in the property.  \n  \n(ii)  A bequest is made to A and his brothers. A and his brothers are jointly entitled \nto the legacy.  \n \n(iii)  A bequest is made to A for life and after his death to his issue. At the death of \nA the property belongs in equal shares to all persons who then answer  the \ndescript ion of issue of A.  \n \n \nPage 49 of 133 \n  98. Bequest to class of persons under general description only.  Where a bequest is made \nto a class of persons under a general description only, no one to whom the words of the description \nare not in their ordinary sense ap plicable shal l take the legacy.  \n \n 99. Construction of terms.  In a will― \n \n(a) the word “children” applies only to lineal descendants in the first degree of the \nperson whose “children” are spoken of;  \n \n(b) the word “grandchildren” applies only to lineal descendants in the second \ndegree of the person whose “grandchildren” are s poken of;  \n  \n(c) the words “nephews” and “nieces” apply only to children of brothers or \nsisters;  \n  \n(d) the words “cousins”, or “first cousins”, or “cousins -german”, apply only to \nchildren of brothers or of sisters of the father or mother of the person whose  \n“cousins”, or “first cousins”, or “cousins -german”, are spoken of;  \n  \n(e) the words “first cousins once removed” apply only to children of cousins -\ngerman, or to cousins -german of a parent of the person whose “first cousins \nonce removed” are spoken of;  \n  \n(f) the words “second cousins” apply only to grandchildren of brothers or of \nsisters of the grandfather or grandmother of the person whose “second \ncousins” are spoken of;  \n  \n(g) the words “issue” and “descendants” apply to all lineal descendants whatever \nof the person whose “issue” or “descendants” are spoken of;  \n  \n(h) words expressive of collateral relationship apply alike to relatives of full and \nof half blood; and  \n \n(i) all words expressive of relationship apply to a child in the womb who is \nafterwards born  alive.  \n \n 100. Words expressing relationship denote only legitimate relatives or failing such \nrelatives reputed legitimate.  In the absence of any intimation to the contrary in a will, the word \n“child”, the word “son”, the word “daughter”, or any word whic h expresses relationship, is to be \nunderstood as denoting only a legitimate relative, or, where there is no such legitimate relative, a \nperson who has acquired, at the date of the will, the reputation of being such relative.  \n  \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A having three children, B, C and D, of whom B and C are legitimate and D is \nillegitimate, leaves his property to be equally divided among “my children”. \nThe property belongs to B and C in equal  shares, to the exclusion of D.  \n \n \nPage 50 of 133 \n (ii)  A, having a niece of illegitimat e birth, who has acquired the reputation of \nbeing his niece, and having no legitimate niece, bequeaths a sum of money to \nhis niece. The illegitimate niece is entitled to the legacy.  \n  \n(iii)  A, having in his will enumerated his children, and named as one o f them B, \nwho is illegitimate, leaves a legacy to “my said children”. B will take a share \nin the legacy alon g with the legitimate children.  \n \n(iv)  A leaves a legacy to “the children of B”. B is dead and has left none but \nillegitimate children. All those wh o had at the date of the will acquired the \nreputation of being the children of B are objects of the gift.  \n  \n(v)  A bequeaths a legacy to “the children of B”. B never had any legitimate child. \nC and D had, at the date of the will, acquired the reputation of  being children \nof B. After the date of the will and before the death of the testator, E and F \nwere born, and acquired the  reputation of being children of B. Only C and D \nare objects of the bequest.  \n \n(vi)  A makes a bequest in favour of his child by a ce rtain woman, not his wife. B \nhad acquired at the date of the will the reputation of being the child of A by \nthe woman designated. B takes the legacy.  \n \n(vii)  A makes a bequest in favour of his child to be born of a woman who never \nbecomes his wife. The be quest is void.  \n \n(viii)  A makes a bequest in favour of the child of which a certain woman, not \nmarried to him, is pregnant. The bequest is valid .  \n \n 101. Rules of construction where will purports to make two bequests to same person.  \nWhere a will purports to make two bequests to the same person, and a question arises whether the \ntestator intended to make the second bequest instead of or in addition to the first; if there is nothing \nin the will to show what he intended, the following rules shall have effect in determining the \nconst ruction to be put upon the will: ― \n \n(a) If the same specific thing is bequeathed twice to the same legatee in the same \nwill or in the will and again in the codicil, he is entitled to receive that specific \nthing only.  \n \n(b) Where one and the same will or one and the same codicil purports to make, in \ntwo places, a bequest to the same person of the same quantity or amount of \nanything, he shall be entitled to one such legacy only.  \n  \n(c) Where two legacies of unequal amount are given to th e same person in the \nsame will, or in the same codicil, the legatee is entitled to both.  \n \n(d) Where two legacies, whether equal or unequal in amount, are given to the \nsame legatee, one by a will and the other by a codicil, or each by a different \ncodicil, the legatee is entitled to both legacies.  \n \n Explanation .___ In clauses (a) to (d) of this section, the word “will” does not include a codicil.  \n \nPage 51 of 133 \n  \nIllustrations  \n \n (i)  A, having ten shares, and no more, in the Imperial Bank of India, made \n his will, which co ntains near its commencement the words “I bequeath \n my ten shares in the Imperial Bank of India to B”. After other \n bequests, the will concludes with the words “and I bequeath my ten \n shares in the Imperial Bank of India to B”. B is entitled simply to \n receive A ’s ten shares in the Imperial Bank of India.  \n \n (ii)  A, having one diamond ring, which was given him by B, bequeaths to \n C the diamond ring which was given by B. A afterwards made a \n codicil to his will, and thereby, after giving other leagacies, he  \n bequeathed to C the diamond ring which was given him by B. C can \n claim nothing except the diamond ring which was given to A by B.  \n  \n (iii)  A, by his will, bequeaths to B the sum of 5, 000 rupees and afterwards \n in the same will repeats the bequest in t he same words. B is entitled to \n one legacy of 5, 000 rupees only.  \n \n (iv)  A, by his will, bequeaths to B the sum of 5, 000 rupees and afterwards \n in the same will bequeaths to B the sum of 6, 000 rupees. B is entitled \n to receive 11, 000 rupees.  \n \n (v)  A, by his will, bequeaths to B 5, 000 rupees and by a codicil to the will \n he bequeaths to him 5, 000 rupees. B is entitled to receive 10, 000 \n rupees.  \n \n (vi)  A, by one codicil  to his will, bequeaths to B 5, 000 rupees and by \n another codicil bequeaths t o him 6, 000 rupees. B is entitled to receive \n 11,000 rupees.  \n \n (vii)  A, by his will, bequeaths “500 rupees to B because she was my nurse”, \n and in another part of the will bequeaths 500 rupees to B “because she \n went to England with my children”. B is ent itled to receive 1, 000 \n rupees.  \n \n (viii)  A, by his will, bequeaths to B the sum of 5, 000 rupees and also, in \n another part of the will, an annuity of 400 rupees. B is entitled to both \n legacies.  \n \n (ix)  A, by his will, bequeaths to B the sum of 5, 000  rupees and also \n bequeaths to him the sum of 5, 000 rupees if he shall attain the age of \n 18. B is entitled absolutely to one sum of 5, 000 rupees, and takes a \n contingent interest in another sum of 5, 000 rupees.  \n \n 102. Constitution of residuary legatee . A residuary legatee may be constituted by any \nwords that show an intention on the part of the testator that the person designated shall take the \nsurplus or residue of his property.  \n \n \nPage 52 of 133 \n Illustrations  \n \n(i)  A makes her will, consisting of several testamentar y papers, in one of which \nare c ontained the following words: — “I think there will be something left, \nafter all funeral expenses, etc., to give to B, now at school, towards equipping \nhim to any profession he may hereafter be appointed to.” B is constituted \nresiduary legatee.  \n  \n(ii)  A makes his will, with the following passage at the end of it: - “I believe there \nwill be found sufficient in my banker ’s hands to defray and discharge my \ndebts, which I hereby, desire B to do, and keep the residue for her own use  and \npleasure.” B is constituted the residuary legatee.  \n \n(iii)  A bequeaths all his property to B, except certain stocks and funds, which he \nbequeaths to C. B is the residuary legatee.   \n \n 103. Property to which residuary legatee entitled.  Under a residuar y bequest, the legatee is \nentitled to all property belonging to the testator at the time of his death, of which he has not made \nany other testamentary disposition which is capable of taking effect.  \n  \nIllustration  \n \n A by his will bequeaths certain legacies,  of which one is void under section 118, and another \nlapses by the death of the legatee. He bequeaths the residue of his property to B. After the date of his \nwill A purchases a zamindari, which belongs to him at the time of his death. B is entitled to the two \nlegacies and the zamindari as part of the residue.  \n \n 104. Time of vesting legacy in general terms.  If a legacy is given in general terms, without \nspecifying the time when it is to be paid, the legatee has a vested interest in it from the day of the \ndeath of the testator, and, if he dies without having received it, it shall pass to his representatives.  \n  \n 105. In what case legacy lapses.___(1) If the legatee does not survive the testator, the legacy \ncannot take effect, but shall lapse and form part of t he residue of the testator ’s property, unless it \nappears by the will that the testator intended that it should go to some other person.  \n \n (2) In order to entitle the representatives of the legatee to receive the legacy, it must be \nproved that he survived the testator.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  The testator bequeaths to B “500 rupees which B owes me”. B dies before the \ntestator; the legacy lapses.  \n \n(ii)  A bequest is made to A and his children. A dies before the testator, or happens \nto be dead when the will is  made. The legacy to A and his children lapses.  \n \n(iii)  A legacy is given to A, and, in case of his dying before the testator, to B. A \ndies before the testator. The legacy goes to B.  \n \n \nPage 53 of 133 \n (iv)  A sum of money is bequeathed to A for life, and after his death to B. A dies in \nthe lifetime of the testator; B survives the testator. The bequest to B takes \neffect.  \n \n(v)  A sum of money is bequeathed to A on his completing his eighteenth year, and \nin case he should die before he completes his eighteenth year, to B. A  \ncompletes his eighteenth year, and dies in the lifetime of the testator. The \nlegacy to A lapses, and the bequest to B does not take effect.  \n \n(vi)  The testator and the legatee perished in the same ship -wreck. There is no \nevidence to show which died first . The legacy lapses.  \n \n 106. Legacy does not lapse if one of two joint legatees die before testator.  If a legacy is \ngiven to two persons jointly, and one of them dies before the testator, the other legatee takes the \nwhole.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n The legacy is si mply to A and B. A dies before the testator. B takes the legacy.  \n \n 107. Ef fect of words showing testator ’s intention to give distinct shares.  If a legacy is \ngiven to legatees in words which show that the testator intended to give them distinct shares of i t, \nthen, if any legatee dies before the testator, so much of the legacy as was intended for him shall fall \ninto the residue of the testator ’s property.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n A sum of money is bequeathed to A, B and C, to be equally divided among them. A dies \nbefore the testator. B and C will only take so much as they would have had if A had survived the \ntestator.  \n  \n 108. When lapsed share goes as undisposed of.  Where a share which lapses is a part of the \ngeneral residue bequeathed by the will, that share shall go  as undisposed of.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n The testator bequeaths the residue of his estate to A, B and C, to be equally divided between \nthem. A dies before the testator. His one - third of the residue goes as undisposed of.  \n \n 109. When bequest to testator ’s chil d or lineal descendant does not lapse on his death in \ntestator ’s lifetime . Where a bequest has been made to any child or other lineal descendant of the \ntestator, and the legatee dies in the lifetime of the testator, but any lineal descendant of his survive s \nthe testator, the bequest shall not lapse, but shall take effect as if the death of the legatee had \nhappened immediately after the death of the testator, unless a contrary  intention appears by the will.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n A makes his will, by which he beque aths a sum of money to his son, B, for his own absolute \nuse and benefit. B dies before A, leaving a son, C, who survives A, and having made his will \nwhereby he bequeaths all his property to his widow, D. The money goes to D.  \n \nPage 54 of 133 \n   \n 110. Bequest to A for benefi t of B does not lapse by A ’s death.  Where a bequest is made to \none person for the benefit of another, the legacy does not lapse by the death, in the testator ’s lifetime, \nof the person to whom the bequest is made.  \n \n 111. Survivorship in case of bequest to described class.  Where a bequest is made simply to \na described class of persons, the thing bequeathed shall go only to such as are alive at the testator ’s \ndeath.  \n \n Exception .___ If property is bequeathed to a class of persons described as standing in a \nparticular degree of kindred to a specified individual, but their possession of it is deferred until a time \nlater than the death of the testator by reason of a prior bequest or otherwise, the property shall at that \ntime go to such of them as are then alive, and to the representatives of any of them who have died \nsince the death of the testator.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A bequeaths 1, 000 rupees to “the children of B” without saying when it is to \nbe distributed among them. B had died previous to the date of the w ill, leaving \nthree children, C, D and E. E died after the date of the will, but before the \ndeath of A. C and D survive A. The legacy will belong to C and D, to the \nexclusion of the representatives of E.  \n \n(ii)  A lease for years of a house, was bequeathed to A for his life, and after his \ndecease to the children of B. At the death of the testator, B had two children \nliving, C and D, and he never had any other child. Afterwards, during the \nlifetime of A, C died, leaving E, his executor. D has survived A, D an d E are \njointly entitled to so much of the leasehold term as remains unexpired.  \n  \n(iii) A sum of money was bequeathed to A for her life, and after her decease to the \nchildren of B. At the death of the testator, B had two children living, C and D, \nand, afte r that event, two children, E and F, were born to B. C and E died in \nthe lifetime of A, C having made a will, E having made no will. A has died, \nleaving D and F surviving her. The legacy is to be divided into four equal \nparts, one of which is to be paid to  the executor of C, one to D, one to the \nadministrator of E and one to F.  \n \n(iv)  A bequeaths one - third of his lands to B for his life, and after his decease to \nthe sisters of B. At the death of the testator, B had two sisters living, C and D, \nand after t hat event another sister E was born. C died during the life of B, D \nand E have survived B. One -third of A ’s land belong to D, E and the \nrepresentatives of C, in equal shares.  \n \n(v)  A bequeaths 1, 000 rupees to B for life and after his death equally among the \nchildren of C. Up to the death of B, C had not had any child. The bequest after \nthe death of B is void.  \n \n(vi)  A bequeaths 1, 000 rupees to “all the children born or to be born” of B to be \ndivided among them at the death of C. At the death of the test ator, B has two \nchildren living, D and E. After the death of the testator, but in the lifetime of \n \nPage 55 of 133 \n C, two other children, F and G, are born to B. After the death of C, another \nchild is born to B. The legacy belongs to D, E, F and G, to the exclusion of the \nafter- born child of B.  \n  \n(vii)  A bequeaths a fund to the children of B, to be divided among them when the \neldest shall attain majority. At the testator ’s death, B had one child living, \nnamed C. He afterwards had two other children, named D and E. E died,  but C \nand D were living when C attained majority. The fund belongs to C, D and the \nrepresentatives of E, to the exclusion of any child who may be born to B after \nC’s attaining majority.  \n_______  \n \nCHAPTER VII  \n \nOF VOID BEQUETS  \n \n 112. Bequest to person by pa rticular description, who is not in existence at testator ’s \ndeath.  Where a bequest is made to a person by a particular description, and there is no person in \nexistence at the testator ’s death who answers the description, the bequest is void.    \n Exception .___ If property is bequeathed to a person described as standing in a particular \ndegree of kindred to a specified individual, but his possession of it is deferred until a time later than \nthe death of the testator, by reason of a prior bequest or otherwise; a nd if a person answering the \ndescription is alive at the death of the testator, or comes into existence between that event and such \nlater time, the property shall, at such later time, go to that person, or, if he is dead, to his \nrepresentatives.  \n  \nIllustra tions  \n \n(i)  A bequeaths 1, 000 rupees to the eldest son of B. At the death of the testator, B \nhas no son. The bequest is void.  \n \n(ii)  A bequeaths 1, 000 rupees to B for life, and after his death to the eldest son of \nC. At the death of the testator, C had n o son. Afterwards, during the life of B, \na son is born to C. Upon B ’s death the legacy goes to C ’s son.    \n(iii)  A bequeaths 1, 000 rupees to B for life, and after his death to the eldest son of \nC. At the death of the testator, C had no son. Afterwards, du ring the life of B, \na son, named D, is born to C. D dies, then B dies. The legacy goes to the \nrepresentative of D.    \n(iv)  A bequeaths his estate of Green Acre to B for life, and at his decease, to the \neldest son of C. Up to the death of B, C has had no so n. The bequest to C ’s \neldest son is void.  \n \n(v)  A bequeaths 1, 000 rupees to the eldest son of C, to be paid to him after the \ndeath of B. At the death of the testator C has no son, but a son is afterwards \nborn to him during the life of B and is alive at B ’s death. C ’s son is entitled to \nthe 1, 000 rupees.  \n \n 113. Bequest to person not in existence at testator ’s death subject to prior bequest.  \nWhere a bequest is made to a person not in existence at the time of the testator ’s death, subject to a \nprior beques t contained in the will, the later bequest shall be void, unless it comprises the whole of \nthe remaining interest of the testator in the thing bequeathed.  \n \nPage 56 of 133 \n  \nIllustrations  \n \n(i) Property is bequeathed to A for his life, and after his death to his eldest son for \nlife, and after the death of the latter to his eldest son. At the time of the \ntestator ’s death, A has no son. Here the bequest to A ’s eldest son is a bequest \nto a person not in existence at the testator ’s  death. It is not a bequest of the \nwhole intere st that remains to the testator. The bequest to A ’s eldest son for \nhis life is void.  \n \n(ii)  A fund is bequeathed to A for his life, and after his death to his daughters. A \nsurvives the testator. A has daughters some of whom were not in existence at \nthe te stator ’s death. The bequest to A ’s daughters comprises the whole interest \nthat remains to the testator in the thing bequeathed. The bequest to A ’s \ndaughters is valid.  \n \n(iii)  A fund is bequeathed to A for his life, and after his death to his daughters, wi th \na direction that, if any of them marries under the age of eighteen, her portion \nshall be settled so that it may belong to herself for life and may be divisible \namong her children after her death. A has no daughters living at the time of the \ntestator ’s death, but has daughters born afterwards who survive him. Here the \ndirection for a settlement has the effect in the case of each daughter who marries \nunder eighteen of substituting for the absolute bequest to her a bequest to her \nmerely for her life; that i s to say, a bequest to a person not in existence at the \ntime of the testator ’s death of something which is less than the whole interest \nthat remains to the testator in the thing bequeathed. The direction to settle the \nfund is void.  \n \n(iv)  A bequeaths a su m of money to B for life, and directs that upon the death of B \nthe fund shall be settled upon his daughters, so that the portion of each \ndaughter may belong to herself for life, and may be divided among her \nchildren after her death. B has no daughter livin g at the time of the testator ’s \ndeath. In this case the only bequest to the  daughters of B is contained in the \ndirection to settle the fund, and this direction amounts to a bequest to persons \nnot yet born, of a life -interest  in the fund, that is to say, of something which is \nless than the whole interest that remains to the testator in the thing bequeathed. \nThe direction to settle the fund upon the daughters of B is void.  \n \n 114. Rule against perpetuity.  No bequest is valid whereby the vesting of the thing  \nbequeathed may be delayed beyond the life -time of one or more persons living at the testator ’s death \nand the minority of some person who shall be in existence at the expiration of that period, and to \nwhom, if he attains full age, the thing bequeathed is t o belong.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A fund is bequeathed to A for his life and after his death to B for his life I and \nafter B ’s death to such of the sons of B as shall first attain the age of 25. A and \nB survive the testator. Here the son of B who shall first  attain the age of 25 \nmay be a son born after the death of the testator; such son may not attain 25 \nuntil more than 18 years have elapsed from the death of the longer liver of A \n \nPage 57 of 133 \n and B; and the vesting of the fund may thus be delayed beyond the lifetime of \nA and B and the minority of the sons of B. The bequest after B ’s death is void.  \n  \n(ii)  A fund is bequeathed to A for his life, and after his death to B for his life, and \nafter B ’s death to such of B ’s sons as shall first attain the age of 25. B dies in \nthe lifetime of the testator, leaving one or more sons. In this case the sons of B \nare persons living at the time of the testator ’s decease, and the time when \neither of them will attain 25 necessarily falls within his own lifetime. The \nbequest is valid.  \n \n(iii)  A fund is bequeathed to A for his life, and after his death to B for his life, with \na direction that after B ’s death it shall be divided amongst such of B ’s children \nas shall attain the age of 18, but that, if no child of B shall attain that age, the \nfund shall go to C. Here the time for the division of the fund must arrive at the \nlatest at the expiration of 18 years from the death of B, a person living at the \ntestator ’s decease. All the bequests are valid.  \n \n(iv)  A fund is bequeathed to trustees for the benefit of the testator ’s daughters, \nwith a direction that, if any of them marry under age, her share of the fund \nshall be settled so as to devolve after her death upon such of her children as \nshall attain the age of 18. Any daughter of the testator to  whom the direction \napplies must be in existence at his decease, and any portion of the fund which \nmay eventually be settled as directed must vest not later than 18 years from the \ndeath of the daughters whose share it was. All these provisions are valid.  \n \n 115. Bequest to a class some of whom may come under rule in Section 113 and 114.  If a \nbequest is made to a class of persons with regard to some of whom it is inoperative by reason of the \nprovisions of section 113 or section 114, such bequest shall be 1[ void in regard to those persons \nonly, and not in regard to the whole class].  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A fund is bequeathed to A for life, and after his death to all his children who \nshall attain the age of 25. A survives the testator, and has some children liv ing \nat the testator ’s death. Each child of A ’s living at the testator ’s death must \nattain the age of 25 (if at all) within the limits allowed for a bequest. But A \nmay have children after the testator ’s decease, some of whom may not attain \nthe age of 25 unt il more than 18 years have elapsed after the decease of A. The \nbequest to A ’s children, therefor, is inoperative as to any child born after the \ntestator ’s death; 2[and in regard to those who do not attain the age of 25 within \n18 years after A ’s death, but is operative in regard to the other children of A].  \n \n(ii)  A fund is bequeathed to A for his life, and after his death to B, C, D and all \nother children of A who shall attain the age of 25. B, C, D are children of A \nliving at the testator ’s decease. In al l other respects the case is the same as that \nsupposed in Illustration ( i). 2[Although the mention of B, C and D does not \nprevent the bequest from being regarded as a bequest to a class, it is not  \nwholly void.

Date of vesting of legacy when payment or possession postponed.  Where by the terms of a \nbequest the legatee is not entitled to immediate possession of the thing bequeathed, a right to receive i t at the \nproper time shall, unless a contrary intention appears by the will, become vested in the legatee on the testator ’s \ndeath, and shall pass to the legatee ’s representatives if he dies before that time and without having \nreceived the legacy, and in su ch cases the legacy is from the testator ’s death said to be vested in \ninterest.  \n \n Explanation.___ An intention that a legacy to any person shall not become vested in interest in \nhim is not to be inferred merely from a provision whereby the payment or poss ession of the thing \nbequeathed is postponed, or whereby a prior interest therein is bequeathed to some other person, or \nwhereby the income arising from the fund bequeathed is directed to be accumulated until the time of \npayment arrives, or from a provision  that, if a particular event shall happen, the legacy shall go over \nto another person.  \n  \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A bequeaths to B 100 rupees, to be paid to him at the death of C. On A ’s death \nthe legacy becomes vested in interest in B, and if he dies before C,  his \nrepresentatives are entitled to the legacy.  \n \nPage 60 of 133 \n  \n(ii) A bequeaths to B 100 rupees, to be paid to him upon his attaining the age of \n18. On A ’s death the legacy becomes vested in interest in B.  \n \n(iii)  A fund is bequeathed to A for life, and after his deat h to B. On the testator ’s \ndeath the legacy to B becomes vested in interest in B.  \n (iv) A fund is bequeathed to A until B attains the age of 18 and then to B. The \nlegacy to B is vested in interest from the testator ’s death.  \n \n(v) A bequeaths the whole of h is property to B upon trust to pay certain debts out \nof the income, and then to make over the fund to C. At A ’s death the gift to C \nbecomes vested in interest in him.  \n \n(vi)  A fund is bequeathed to A, B and C in equal shares to be paid to them on their \nattaining the age of 18, respectively, with a proviso that, if all of them die \nunder the age of 18, the legacy shall devolve upon D. On the death of the \ntestator, the shares vested in interest in A, B and C, subject to be divested in \ncase A, B and C shall al l die under 18, and, upon the death of any of them \n(except the last survivor) under the age of 18, his vested interest passes, so \nsubject, to his representatives.  \n \n 120. Date of vesting when legacy contingent upon specified uncertain event.___(1) A \nlegacy  bequeathed in case a specified uncertain event shall happen does not vest until that event \nhappens.  \n \n (2) A legacy bequeathed in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen does not vest \nuntil the happening of that event becomes impossible.  \n \n (3) In either case, until the condition has been fulfilled, the interest of the legatee is called \ncontingent.  \n \n Exception .___ Where a fund is bequeathed to any person upon his attaining a particular age, \nand the will also gives to him absolutely the income to  arise from the fund before he reaches that age, \nor directs the income, or so much of it as may be necessary, to be applied for his benefit, the bequest \nof the fund is not contingent.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A legacy is bequeathed to D in case A, B and C sha ll all die under the age of \n18. D has a contingent interest in the legacy until A, B and C all die under 18, \nor one of them attains that age.  \n  \n(ii)  A sum of money is bequeathed to A “in case he shall attain the age of 18”, or \n“when he shall attain the a ge of 18”. A ’s interest in the legacy is contingent \nuntil the condition is fulfilled by his attaining that age.  \n \n(iii)  An estate is bequeathed to A for life, and after his death to B if B shall then be \nliving; but if B shall not be then living to C. A, B  and C survive the testator. B \nand C each take a contingent interest in the estate until the event which is to \nvest it in one or in the other has happened.  \n \nPage 61 of 133 \n  \n(iv)  An estate is bequeathed as in the case last supposed. B dies in the lifetime of A \nand C. Upo n the death of B, C acquires a vested right to obtain possession of \nthe estate upon A ’s death.  \n \n(v)  A legacy is bequeathed to A when she shall attain the age of 18, or shall marry \nunder that age with the consent of B, with a proviso that, if she neither attains \n18 nor marries under that age with B ’s consent, the legacy shall go to C. A and \nC each take a contingent interest in the legacy. A attains the age of 18. A \nbecomes absolutely entitled to the legacy although she may have married \nunder 18 without the  consent of B.  \n \n(vi)  An estate is bequeathed to A until he shall marry and after that event to B. B ’s \ninterest in the bequest is contingent until the condition is fulfilled by A ’s \nmarrying.  \n \n(vii)  An estate is bequeathed to A until he shall take advant age of any law for the \nrelief of insolvent debtors, and after that event to B. B ’s interest in the bequest \nis contingent until A takes advantage of such a law.  \n \n(viii)  An estate is bequeathed to A if he shall pay 500 rupees to B. A ’s interest in the \nbequ est is contingent until he has paid 500 rupees to B.  \n \n(ix)  A leaves his farm of Sultanpur Khurd to B, if B shall convey his own farm of \nSultanpur Buzurg to C. B ’s interest in the bequest is contingent until he has \nconveyed the latter farm to C.  \n \n(x)  A fund is bequeathed to A if B shall not marry C within five years after the \ntestator ’s death. A ’s interest in the legacy is contingent until the condition is \nfulfilled by the expiration of the five years without B ’s having married C, or \nby the occurrence wi thin that period of an event which makes the fulfilment of \nthe condition impossible.  \n \n(xi)  A fund is bequeathed to A if B shall not make any provision for him by will. \nThe legacy is contingent until B ’s death.  \n \n(xii)  A bequeaths to B 500 rupees a year upon his attaining the age of 18, and \ndirects that the interest, or a competent part thereof, shall be applied for his \nbenefit until he reaches that age. The legacy is vested.  \n \n(xiii)  A bequeaths to B 500 rupees when he shall attain the age of 18, and di rects \nthat a certain sum, out of another fund, shall be applied for his maintenance \nuntil he arrives at that age. The legacy is contingent.  \n \n 121. Vesting of interest in bequest to such members of a class as shall have attained \nparticular age.  Where a beq uest is made only to such members of a class as shall have attained a \nparticular age, a person who has not attained that age cannot have a vested interest in the legacy.  \n \n Illustration  \n A fund is bequeathed to such of the children of A as shall attain the  age of 18, with a \ndirection that, while any child of A shall be under the age of 18, the income of the share, to which it \n \nPage 62 of 133 \n may be presumed he will be eventually entitled, shall be applied for his maintenance and education. \nNo child of A who is under the ag e of 18 has a vested interest in the bequest.  \n____  \n \nCHAPTER IX  \n \nOF ONEROUS BEQUESTS  \n \n 122. Onerous bequests . Where a bequest imposes an obligation on the legatee, he can take \nnothing by it unless he accepts it fully.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n A, having shares in ( X), a prosperous joint stock company and also shares in (Y), a joint \nstock company in difficulties, in respect of which shares heavy calls are expected to be made, \nbequeaths to  B all his shares in joint stock companies; B refuses to accept the shares in (Y ). He \nforfeits the shares in (X).  \n \n 123. One of two separate and independent bequests to same person may be accepted, \nand other refused . Where a will contains two separate and independent bequests to the same person, \nthe legatee is at liberty to accept on e of them and refuse the other, although the former may be \nbeneficial and the latter onerous.  \nIllustration  \n \n A, having a lease for a term of years of a house at a rent which he and his representatives are \nbound to pay during the term, and which is higher than the house can be let for, bequeaths to B the \nlease and a sum of money. B refuses to accept the lease. He will not by this refusal forfeit the money.  \n  \n___ \n \nCHAPTER X  \n \nOF CONTINGENT BEQUESTS  \n \n 124. Bequest contingent upon specified uncertain event, no time being mentioned for its \noccurrence.  Where a legacy is given if a specified uncertain event shall happen and no time is \nmentioned in the will for the occurrence of that event, the legacy cannot take effect, unless such \nevent happens before the period w hen the fund bequeathed is payable or distributable.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A legacy is bequeathed to A, and, in case of his death, to B. If A survives the \ntestator, the legacy to B does not take effect.  \n \n(ii)  A legacy is bequeathed to A, and, in case of his death without children, to B. If \nA survives the testator or dies in his lifetime leaving a child, the legacy to B \ndoes not take effect.  \n \n(iii)  A legacy is bequeathed to A when and if he attains the age of 18, and, in case \nof his death, to B. A attain s the age of 18. The legacy to B does not take effect.  \n \n \nPage 63 of 133 \n (iv)  A legacy is bequeathed to A for life, and, after his death to B, and, “in case of \nB’s death without children”, to C. The words “in case of B ’s death without \nchildren” are to be understood as me aning “in case B dies without children \nduring the lifetime of A” . \n \n(v)  A legacy is bequeathed to A for life, and, after his death to B, and, “in case of \nB’s death”, to C. The words “in case of B ’s death” are to be considered as \nmeaning “in case B dies in the lifetime of A”.  \n \n 125. Bequest to such of certain persons as shall be surviving at some period not \nspecified.  Where a bequest is made to such of certain persons as shall be surviving at some period, \nbut the exact period is not specified, the legacy sh all go to such of them as are alive at the time of \npayment or distribution, unless a contrary intention appears by the will.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  Property is bequeathed to A and B to be equally divided between them, or to \nthe survivor of them. If both A a nd B survive the testator, the legacy is equally \ndivided between them. If A dies before the testator, and B survives the \ntestator, it goes to B.  \n \n(ii)  Property is bequeathed to A for life, and, after his death, to B and C, to be \nequally divided between t hem, or to the survivor of them. B dies during the \nlife of A; C survives A. At A ’s death the legacy goes to C.  \n \n(iii)  Property is bequeathed to A for life, and after his death to B and C, or the \nsurvivor, with a direction that, if B should not survive th e testator, his children \nare to stand in his place. C dies during the life of the testator; B survives the \ntestator, but dies in the lifetime of A. The legacy goes to the representative of \nB.  \n \n(iv)  Property is bequeathed to A for life, and, after his dea th, to B and C, with a \ndirection that, in case either of them dies in the lifetime of A, the whole shall \ngo to the survivor. B dies in the lifetime of A. Afterwards C dies in the \nlifetime of A. The legacy goes to the representative of C.  \n \n______  \n \nCHAPTER XI \n \nOF CONDITIONAL BEQUESTS  \n \n 126.

Where a will imposes a \ncondition to be fulfilled before the legatee can take a vested interest in the thing bequeathed, the \ncondition shall be considered to have been fulfilled if it has been substantially co mplied with.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A legacy is bequeathed to A on condition that he shall marry with the consent \nof B, C, D and E. A marries with the written consent of B, C is present at the \nmarriage. D sends a present to A previous to the marriage.

In order that a condition that a \nbequest shall cease to have effect may be valid, it is necessary that the event to which it relates be \none which could legally constitute the con dition of a bequest as contemplated by section 120.  \n \n 136. Result of legatee rendering impossible or indefinitely postponing act for which no \ntime specified, and on non -performance of which subject matter to go over .

Performance of condition, precedent or subsequent, within specified time. Further \ntime in case  of fraud.  Where the will requires an act to be performed by the legatee within a \nspecified time, either as a condition to be fulfilled before the legacy is enjoyed, or as a condition \nupon the non - fulfilment of which the subject - matter of the bequest is to go over to another person \nor the bequest is to cease to have effect, the act must be performed within the time specified, unless \nthe performance of it be prevented by fraud, in which case such further time shall be allowed as shall \nbe requisite to make up for the delay caused by such fraud.  \n____  \n \nCHAPTER XII  \n \nOF BEQUESTS WITH DIRECTIONS AS TO APPLICATION OR ENJOYMENT  \n \n 138. Direction that fund be employed in particular manner following absolute bequest \nof same to or for benefit of any person . Where a fu nd is bequeathed absolutely to or for the benefit \nof any person, but the will contains a direction that it shall be applied or enjoyed in a particular \nmanner, the legatee shall be entitled to receive the fund as if the will had contained no such direction.    \nIllustration  \n \n A sum of money is bequeathed towards purchasing a country residence for A, or to purchase \nan annuity for A, or to place A in any business. A chooses to receive the legacy in money. He is \nentitled to do so.    \n 139. Direction that mode of enjoyment of absolute bequest is to be restricted, to secure \nspecified benefit for legatee.  Where a testator absolutely bequeaths a fund, so as to sever it from his \nown estate but directs that the mode of enjoyment of it by the legatee shall be restricted so as to \nsecure a specified benefit for the legatee; if that benefit cannot be obtained for the legatee, the fund \nbelongs to him as if the will had contained no such direction.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i) A bequeaths the residue of his property to be divided equa lly among his \ndaughters, and directs that the shares of the daughters shall be settled upon \nthemselves respectively for life and be paid to their children after their death. \nAll the daughters die unmarried.

The daughter \ndies without having ever had a child. Her representatives are entitled to the \nfund.  \n \n 140. Bequest of fund for certain purposes, some of which cannot be fulfilled.  Where a \ntestator does not absolutely bequeath a fund, so as to sever i t from his own estate, but gives it for \ncertain purposes, and part of those purposes cannot be fulfilled, the fund, or so much of it as has not \nbeen exhausted upon the objects contemplated by the will, remains a part of the estate of the testator.  \n \nIllust rations  \n \n(i)  A directs that his trustees shall invest a sum of money in a particular way, and \nshall pay the interest to his son for life, and at his death shall divide the \nprincipal among his children.

C \nis also to receive 500 rupees out of the general assets of the testator.  \n____  \n \nCHAPTER XVI  \n \nOF ADEMPTION OF LEGACIES  \n \n 152. Ademption explained . If anything which has been specifically bequeathed does not \nbelong to the testator at the time  of his death, or has been converted into property of a different kind, \nthe legacy is adeemed: that is, it cannot take effect, by reason of the subject - matter having been  \nwithdrawn from the operation of the will.  \n \n \n1 Subs. by the Federal Laws (Revision an d Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s. 3 and Sch., II for “Rampur”.  \n2 Subs. by F.A.O., 1975, Art. 2 and Table, for “Central Government” which was previously amended by A.O., 1937, for “G. of I.”.  \n3 Subs. by Ord. 27 of 1981, s. 3 and Sch., II, for “Ramnagar”.  \n \nPage 74 of 133 \n Illustrations  \n(i)  A bequeaths to B ― \n \n    “the diamond ring presented to me by C”:  \n    “my gold chain”:  \n    “a certain bale of wool”:  \n    “a certain piece of cloth”:  \n    “all my household goods which shall be in or about my dwelling -  \n    hous e in M Street in 1[Sahiwal], at the time of my death” ;  \n \n   A in his lifetime,___  \n \n    sells or gives away the ring:  \n    converts the chain into a cup:  \n    converts the wool into cloth:  \n    makes the cloth into a garment:  \n    takes another house into which he removes all his goods.  \n \n   Each of these legacies is adeemed.  \n \n(ii)  A bequeaths to B ― \n \n    “the sum of 1, 000 rupees, in a certain chest”:  \n    “all the horses in my stable”.  \n  At the death of A, no money is found in the chest, and no horses in the stable. The \nlegacies are adeemed.  \n \n  (iii)  A bequeaths to B certain bales of goods. A tak es the goods with him on a  \n   voyage. The ship and goods are lost at sea, and A is drowned. The legacy is \n   adeemed.   \n \n 153. Non - ademption of demonstrative legacy.  A demonstrative legacy is not adeemed by \nreason that the property on which it is charged b y the will does not exist at the time of the death of \nthe testator, or has been converted into property of a different kind, but it shall in such case be paid \nout of the general assets of the testator.  \n \n 154. Ademption of specific bequest of right to recei ve something from third party.  \nWhere the thing specifically bequeathed is the right to receive something of value from a third party, \nand the testator himself receives it, the bequest is adeemed.  \n \n \nIllustrations  \n(i) A bequeaths to B ― \n \n   “the debt which C  owes me”:  \n   “2, 000 rupees which I have in the hands of D”:  \n   “the money due to me on the bond of E”:  \n \n1 Subs. by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s. 3 and Sch., II, for “Dacca”, which was p reviously amended by \nOrd. 21 of 1960, s. 3 and 2nd Sch., for “Calcutta”, ( w.e.f. 14th Oct., 1955).  \n \nPage 75 of 133 \n    “my mortgage on the 1[Rahimyarkhan] factory”.  \n \n All these debts are extinguished in A ’s lifetime, some with and some without his consent. All \nthe legacies are adeemed.  \n \n(ii)  A bequeaths to B his interest in certain policies of his life assurance. A in his \nlifetime receives the amount of the policies. The legacy is adeemed.  \n \n 155. Ademption pro t anto by testator ’s receipt of part of entire thing specifically \nbequeathed.  The rec eipt by the testator of a part of an entire thing specifically bequeathed shall \noperate as an ademption of the legacy to the extent of the sum so received.  \n  \n \nIllustration  \n \n A bequeaths to B “the debt due to me by C”. The debt amounts to 10, 000 rupees. C pays to \nA 5,000 rupees the one -half of the debt. The legacy is revoked by ademption, so far as regards the \n5,000 rupees received by A.  \n \n 156. Ademption pro t ento by testator ’s receipt of portion of entire fund of which portion \nhas been specifically bequeat hed. If a portion of an entire fund or stock is specifically bequeathed, \nthe receipt by the testator of a portion of the fund or stock shall operate as an ademption only to the \nextent of the amount so received; and the residue of the fund or stock shall be  applicable to the \ndischarge of the specific legacy.  \n \n \nIllustration  \n \n A bequeaths to B one -half of the sum of 10,000 rupees due to him from W. A in his lifetime \nreceives 6,000 rupees, part of the 10,000 rupees. The 4, 000 rupees which are due from W to A at the \ntime of his death belong to B under the specific bequest.  \n \n \n 157. Order of payment where portion of fund specifically bequeathed to one legatee, and \nlegacy charged . on same fund to another, and, testator having received portion of that fund, \nremain der insufficient to pay both legacies.  Where a portion of a fund is specifically bequeathed to one \nlegatee, and a legacy charged on the same fund is bequeathed to another legatee, then, if the testator \nreceives a portion of that fund, and the remainder of the fund is insufficient to pay both the specific and \nthe demonstrative legacy, the specific legacy shall be paid first, and the residue (if any) of the fund \nshall be applied so far as it will extend in payment of the demonstrative legacy, and the rest of the \ndemonstrative legacy shall be paid out of the general assets of the testator.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n A bequeaths to B 1,000 rupees, part of the debt of 2,000 rupees due to him from W. He also \nbequeaths to C 1,000 rupees to be paid out of the debt due to him f rom W. A afterwards receives \n2[500] rupees, part of that debt, and dies leaving only 1,500 rupees due to him from W. Of these \n1,500 rupees, 1,000 rupees belong to B, and 500 rupees are to be paid to C. C is also to receive 500 \nrupees out of the g eneral ass ets of the testator.  \n \n \n1Subs. by the Central Laws (Statute Reform) Ordinance, 1960 (21 of 1960), s. 3. and 2nd Sch., for “Rampur” ( with effect from the 24th October, 1955 ). \n2 Subs. by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1927 (10 of 1927), s. 2 and 1st Sch., fo r “5000”.  \n \n \nPage 76 of 133 \n  158. Ademption where stock, specifically bequeathed, does not exist at testator ’s death.  \nWhere stock which has been specifically bequeathed does not exist at the testator ’s death, the legacy \nis adeemed.  \n  \nIllustration  \n A bequeaths to B___ \n  “my capital stock of 1, 000 in East India Stock”:  \n  “my promissory notes of the 1[Federal Government] for 10, 000 rupees in their  \n  4 per cent. l oan”.  \n A sells the stock and the notes. The legacies are adeemed.  \n \n 159. Ademption pro ta nto where stock, speci fically bequeathed, exists in part only at \ntestator ’s death.  Where stock which has been specifically bequeathed exists only in part at the \ntestator ’s death, the legacy is adeemed so far as regards that part of the stock which has ceased to \nexist.  \n \nIllustra tion \n A bequeaths to B his 10,000 rupees in the 5 -1/2 per cent. loan of the 1[Federal Government]. \nA sells one - half of his 10, 000 rupees in the loan in question. One - half of the legacy is adeemed.  \n \n 160. Non -ademption of specific bequest of goods descr ibed as connected with certain \nplace, by reason of removal . A specific bequest of goods under a description connecting them with \na certain place is not adeemed by reason that they have been removed from such place from any \ntemporary cause, or by fraud, or without the knowledge or sanction of the testator.  \n \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A bequeaths to B “all my household goods which shall be in or about my \ndwelling - house in 2[Faisalabad]  at the time of my death”. The goods are \nremoved from the house to save them fr om fire. A dies before they are brought \nback.  \n \n(ii)  A bequeaths to B “all my household goods which shall be in or about my \ndwelling - house in 2[Faisalabad] at the time of my death”. During A ’s absence \nupon a journey, the whole of the goods are removed fr om the house. A dies \nwithout having sanctioned their removal.  \n \n Neither of these legacies is adeemed.  \n \n 161. When removal of thing bequeathed does not constitute ademption.  The removal of \nthe thing bequeathed from the place in which it is stated in the wil l to be situated does not constitute \nan ademption, where the place is only referred to in order to complete the description of what the \ntestator meant to bequeath.  \n \n  \n1 Subs. by F.A.O., 1975, Art. 2 and Table, for “Central Government “ which was previously  amended by A. O., 1937, for “G. of I.”.  \n2 Subs. by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s. 3 and Sch., II for “Calcutta”.  \n \nPage 77 of 133 \n Illustrations  \n \n(i)  A bequeaths to B “all the bills, bonds and other securities for money belon ging \nto me now lying in my lodgings in 1[Karachi]”. At the time of his death these \neffects had been removed from his lodgings in 1[Karachi].  \n \n(ii)  A bequeaths to B all his furniture then in his house in 1[Karachi]. The testator \nhas a house at 1[Karachi] and another at 2[Quetta], in which he lives \nalternately, being possessed of one set of furniture only which he removes \nwith himself to each house. At the time of his death the furniture is in the \nhouse at 2[Quetta].  \n \n(iii)  A bequeaths to B all his goods on board a certain ship then lying in the river \n3[Indus]. The goods are removed by A ’s directions to a warehouse, in which \nthey remain at the time of A ’s death.  \n  \nNo one of these legacies is revoked by ademption.  \n \n 162. When thing bequeathed is a valuable  to be received by testator from third person; \nand testator himself, or his representative, receives it . Where the thing bequeathed is not the right \nto receive something of value from a third person, but the money or other commodity which may be \nreceived f rom third person by the testator himself or by his representatives, the receipt of such sum \nof money or other commodity by the testator shall not constitute an ademption; but if he mixes it up \nwith the general mass of his property, the legacy is adeemed.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n A bequeaths to B whatever sum may be received from his claim on C. A receives the whole \nof his claim on C, and sets it apart from the general mass of his property. The legacy is not adeemed.  \n \n 163. Change by operation of law of subject of specific bequest between date of will and \ntestator ’s death .

At A ’s death there was due \nfrom him the sum of 100 rupees in respect of each share, being the amount of \na call which had been duly made, and the sum of five rupees i n respect of each \nshare, being the amount of interest which had accrued due in respect of the \ncall. These payments must be borne by A ’s estate.  \n \n(ii)  A has agreed to take 50 shares in an intended joint stock company, and has \ncontracted to pay up 100 rupe es in respect of each share, which sum must be \npaid before his title to the shares can be completed.

Testator ’s belief as to his ownership immaterial.  The provisions of sections 180 and \n181 apply whether the testator does or does not believe that which he professes to dispose of by his \nwill to be his own.  \n \nPage 83 of 133 \n Illustrations  \n \n(i)  The farm of Sultanpur was the property of C. A bequeathed it to B, giving a \nlegacy of 1,000 rupees to C. C has elected to retain his farm of Sultanpur, \nwhich is worth 800 rupees. C forfeits his legacy of 1, 000 rupees, of which 800 \nrupees goes to B, and the remaining 200 rupees falls into the residuary \nbequest, or devolves according to the rules of intestate succession, as the case \nmay be.  \n \n(ii)  A bequeaths an estate to B in case B ’s elder brother (who i s married and has \nchildren) shall leave no issue living at his death.

B must elect to give up the estate or to \nlose the legacy.  \n \n \n(iv)  A, a person of the age of 18, domiciled in 1[Pakistan] but owning re al property \nin England, to which C is heir at law, bequeaths a legacy to C and, subject \nthereto, devises and bequeaths to B “all my property whatsoever and \nwheresoever”, and dies under 21. The real property in England does not pass \nby the will. C may claim  his legacy without giving up the real property in \nEngland.  \n \n 183. Bequest for man ’s benefit how regarded for purpose of election . A bequest for a \nperson ’s benefit is, for the purpose of election, the same thing as a bequest made to himself.  \n \nIllustratio n \n \n The farm of Sultanpur Khurd being the property of B, A bequeathed it to C: and bequeathed \nanother farm called Sultanpur Buzurg to his own executors with a direction that it should be sold and \nthe proceeds applied in payment of B ’s debts. B must elect w hether he will abide by the will, or keep \nhis farm of Sultanpur Khurd in opposition to it.  \n  \n 184. Person deriving benefit indirectly not put to election.  A person taking no benefit \ndirectly under a will, but deriving a benefit under it indirectly, is not put to his election.  \n  \nIllustration  \n \n The lands of Sultanpur are settled upon C for life, and after his death upon D, his only child. \nA bequeaths the lands of Sultanpur to B, and 1, 000 rupees to C. C dies intestate shortly after the \ntestator, and without having made any election. D takes out administration to C, and as administrator \nelects on behalf of C ’s estate to take under the will. In that capacity he receives the legacy of 1, 000 \nrupees and accounts to B for the rents of the lands of Sultanpur which accrued after the death of the \ntestator and before the death of C. In his individual character he retains the lands of Sultanpur in \nopposition to the will.  \n  \n  \n1 Subs. by the Central Laws (Statute Reform) Ordinance, 1960 (21 of 1960), s. 3 and 2nd Sch. ( with effect from the 14th October, 1955 ), for “the \nProvinces and the Capital of the Federation” which had been subs. by A.O., 1949, for “British India”.  \n \n \nPage 84 of 133 \n  185. Person taking in individual capacity under will may in other character elect to take \nin opposition . A person who in his individual capacity takes a benefit under a will may, in another \ncharacter, elect to take in opposition to the will.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n The estate of Sultanpur is settled upon A for life, and after his death, upon B. A leaves the \nestate  of Sultanpur to D, and 2, 000 rupees to B, and 1, 000 rupees to C, who is B ’s only child. B dies \nintestate, shortly after the testator, without having made an election. C takes out administration to B, \nand as administrator elects to keep the estate of Sul tanpur in opposition to the will, and to relinquish \nthe legacy of 2, 000 rupees. C may do this, and yet claim his legacy of 1, 000 rupees under the will.  \n \n 186. Exception to provisions of last six sections.  Notwithstanding anything contained in \nsections 1 80 to 185, where a particular gift is expressed in the will to be in lieu of something \nbelonging to the legatee, which is also in terms disposed of by the will, then, if the legatee claims \nthat thing, he must relinquish the particular gift, but he is not b ound to relinquish any other benefit \ngiven to him by the will.  \n \n \nIllustration  \n \n Under A ’s marriage -settlement his wife is entitled, if she survives him, to the enjoyment of \nthe estate of Sultanpur during her life. A by his will bequeaths to his wife an ann uity of 200 rupees \nduring her life, in lieu of her interest in the estate of Sultanpur, which estate he bequeaths to his son. \nHe also gives his wife a legacy of 1, 000 rupees. The widow elects to take what she is entitled to \nunder the settlement. She is bo und to relinquish the annuity but not the legacy of 1, 000 rupees.  \n  \n 187. When acceptance of benefit given by will constitutes election to take under will.  \nAcceptance of a benefit given by a will constitutes an election by the legatee to take under the wi ll, if \nhe had knowledge of his right to elect and of those circumstances which would influence the \njudgment of a reasonable man in making an election, or if he waives inquiry into the circumstances.  \n  \nIllustrations  \n \n(i)  A is owner of an estate called Sult anpur Khurd, and has a life interest in \nanother estate called Sultanpur Buzurg to which upon his death his son B will \nbe absolutely entitled. The will of A gives the estate of Sultanpur Khurd to B, \nand the estate of Sultanpur Buzurg to C. B, in ignorance o f his own right to the \nestate of Sultanpur Buzurg, allows C to take possession of it, and enters into \npossession of the estate of Sultanpur Khurd. B has not confirmed the bequest \nof Sultanpur Buzurg to C.  \n \n(ii)  B, the eldest son of A, is the possessor of  an estate called Sultanpur. A \nbequeaths Sultanpur to C, and to B the residue of A ’s property. B having been \ninformed by A ’s executors that the residue will amount to 5, 000 rupees, \nallows C to take possession of Sultanpur. He afterwards discovers that the  \nresidue does not amount to more than 500 rupees. B has not confirmed the \nbequest of the estate of Sultanpur to C.  \n \n 188. Circumstances in which knowledge or waiver is presumed or inferred.___(1) Such \nknowledge or waiver of inquiry shall, in the absence o f evidence to the contrary, be presumed if the \n \nPage 85 of 133 \n legatee has enjoyed for two years the benefits provided for him by the will without doing any act to \nexpress dissent.  \n  \n (2) Such knowledge or waiver of inquiry may be inferred from any act of the legatee whic h \nrenders it impossible to place the persons interested in the subject - matter of the bequest in the same \ncondition as if such act had not been done.  \n \nIllustration  \n \n A bequeaths to B an estate to which C is entitled, and to C a coal mine. C takes possessi on of \nthe mine and exhausts it. He has thereby confirmed the bequest of the estate to B.  \n \n 189. When testator ’s representatives may call upon legatee to elect.  If the legatee does \nnot, within one year after the death of the testator, signify to the testat or’s representatives his \nintention to confirm or to dissent from the will, the representatives shall, upon the expiration of that \nperiod, require him to make his election; and, if he does not comply with such requisition within a \nreasonable time after he h as received it, he shall be deemed to have elected to confirm the will.  \n \n 190. Postponement of election in case of disability.  In case of disability the election shall \nbe postponed until the disability ceases, or until the election is made by some compete nt authority.  \n____  \n \nCHAPTER XXIII  \n \nOF GIFTS IN CONTEMPLATION OF DEATH  \n \n 191.

Refund when legacy has become due on performance of condition within further \ntime allowed under section 137.  When the time prescribed by the will for the performa nce of a \ncondition has elapsed, without the condition having been performed, and the executor or \nadministrator has thereupon, without fraud, distributed the assets ; in such case, if further time has \nbeen allowed under section 137 for the performance of th e condition, and the condition has been \nperformed accordingly, the legacy cannot be claimed from the executor or administrator, but those to \nwhom he has paid it are liable to refund the amount.  \n \n 359.

When legatee, not satisfied or compelled to refund under section 361, cannot oblige \none paid in full to refund.  If the assets were sufficient to satisfy all the legacies at the time of the \ntestator ’s death, a legatee who has not  received payment of his legacy, or who has been compelled to \nrefund under section 361, cannot oblige one who has received payment in full to refund, whether the \nlegacy were paid to him with or without suit, although the assets have subsequently become def icient \nby the wasting of the executor.  \n \n 363. When unsatisfied legatee must first proceed against executor, if solvent.  If the assets \nwere not sufficient to satisfy all the legacies at the time of the testator ’s death, a legatee who has not \nreceived payme nt of his legacy must, before he can call on a satisfied legatee to refund, first proceed \nagainst the executor or administrator if he is solvent; but if the executor or administrator is insolvent \nor not liable to pay, the unsatisfied legatee can oblige eac h satisfied legatee to refund in proportion.  \n \n 364. Limit to refunding of one legatee to another.  The refunding of one legatee to another \nshall not exceed the sum by which the satisfied legacy ought to have been reduced if the estate had \nbeen properly adm inistered.    \nIllustration    \n A has bequeathed 240 rupees to B, 480 rupees to C, and 720 rupees to D. The assets are only \n1, 200 rupees and, if properly administered, would give 200 rupees to B , 400 rupees to C and 600 \nrupees to D.
