Power of Court to adopt proceedings of voluntary winding up.—Where a company is \nbeing wound up voluntarily, and an order is made for winding up by the Court, the Court may, if it thinks \nfit by the same or any subsequent order, provide for the adoption of all or any of the proceedings in the \nvoluntary winding up. \n \nWINDING UP SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION OF COURT \n \n381.

Fraudulent preference.—(1) Where a company has given preference to a person who is \none of the creditors of the company or a surety or guarantor for any of the debts or other liabilities of the \ncompany, and the company does anything or suffers anything done which has the effect of putting that \nperson into a position which, in the event of the company going into liquidation,  will be better than the \nposition he would have been in if that thing had not been done prior to one hundred and eighty days of \ncommencement of winding up, the Court, if satisfied that, such transaction is a fraudulent preference may \norder as it may think fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the company had not given \nthat preference. \n \n(2)  If the Court is satisfied that there is a preference transfer of property, movable or \nimmovable, or any delivery of goods, payment, execution made, taken or done by or against a company \nwithin one hundred and eighty days before the commencement of winding up, the Court may order as \nit may think fit and may declare such transaction invalid and restore the position. \n \n394.  Liabilities and rights of certain fraudulently preferred persons.—(1) Where, in the \ncase of a company which is being wound up, anything made or done after the commencement of this \nAct, is invalid under section 393 as a fraudulent preference of a person interested in property mortgaged \nor charged to secure the company’s  debt, then (without prejudice to any rights or liabilities arising apart \nfrom this provision) the person preferred shall be subject to the same liabilities and shall have the same \nrights as if he had undertaken to be personally liable as surety for the debt to the extent of the charge on \nthe property or the value of his interest, whichever is less. \n \nPage 243 of 394 \n  \n(2)  The value of the said person’ s interest shall be determined as at the date of the \ntransaction constituting the fraudulent preference, and shall be determined as if the interest were free of \nall encumbrances other than those to which the charge for the company’s  debt was then subject. \n \n(3)  On any application made to the Court with respect to any payment on the ground that the \npayment was a fraudulent preference of a surety or guarantor, the Court shall have jurisdiction to \ndetermine any questions with respect to the payment arising between the person to whom the payment \nwas made and the surety or guarantor and to grant relief in respect thereof, notwithstanding  that it is not \nnecessary so to do for the purposes of the winding up, and for that purpose may give leave to bring in the \nsurety or guarantor as a third party as in the case of a suit for the recovery of the sum paid. \n \n(4)  Sub-section (3) shall apply, with the necessary modifications, in relation to transactions \nother than the payment of money as it applied in relation to such payments. \n \n395.  Avoidance of certain attachments, executions.—(1) Where any company is being \nwound up by or subject to the supervision of the Court, any attachment, distress or execution put in force \nwithout leave of the Court against the estate or effects or any sale held without leave of the Court of any \nof the properties of the company after the commencement of the winding up shall be void. \n \n(2)  Nothing in this section applies to proceedings by the Government. \n \n396.
