In such a \ncase “domestic industry ” may mean the rest of the domestic producers:  \n \n \nPage 7 of 39 \n Explanation .— For the purposes of this clause, prod ucers shall \nbe deemed to be related to exporters or importers only if — \n \n(i)  one of them directly or indirectly controls the other;  \n \n(ii)  both of them are directly or indirectly controlled by the same third \nperson; or  \n \n(iii)  together they directly or ind irectly control a third person:  \n \nProvided that there are grounds for believing or suspecting that \nthe effect of the relationship is such as to cause the producer concerned \nto behave differently from non­ related producers. For that purpose one \nshall be dee med to control another when the former is legally or \noperationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the \nlatter;  \n \nProvided further that, in exceptional circumstances, as may be \ndetermined by the Commission, domestic industry in relation to a \nproduct in question may be divided into two or more competitive \nmarkets and producers within each such market may be regarded as  a \nseparate industry if — \n \n(i)  the producers within such a market sell all or almost all of their \nproduction of the product in question in such a market; and  \n \n(ii)  the demand in such a market is not, to any substantial degree, supplied \nby producers of the  product in question located elsewhere in Pakistan;  \n \n(e)  “Domestic like product ” means a “like product ” that is produced by the \ndomestic Industry;  \n \n(f)  “Dumping margin ” in relation to a product, means the amount by which its \nnormal value exceeds its expo rt price;  \n \n(g)  “Export price ” means export price determined in accordance with Part IV of \nthis Act;  \n \n(h)  “Exporting country ” means, save as provided in sub­section (3) of section 5, a \ncountry from which an investigated product is exported to Pakistan;  \n \n1[(ha) “foreign grant -in-aid projects” means grants made to the Government of \nPakistan under section 7 of the Public Finance Ma nagement Act, 2019 ;] \n \n(i) “Injury ” means, unless otherwise specified, material injury to a domestic \nindustry, threat of material i njury to a domestic industry or material retardation \nof the establishment of a domestic industry, when dumped imports are causing \nsuch injury;  \n \n \n1Ins. by The Anti -Dumping Duties (Amdt) Act, 2022 (XXIX of 2022) , s. 2. \n \nPage 8 of 39 \n (j)  “interested party ” includes — \n \n(i)  any exporter or foreign producer of an investigated product;  \n \n(ii)  any importer of an investigated product;  \n \n(iii) trade or business association a majority of the members of which are \nproducers, exporters or importers of an investigated product;  \n \n(iv)  the government of an exporting country;  \n \n(v) any producer of a domestic like product in Pakistan;  \n \n(vi)  trade or business associations a majority of the members of which \nproduce a domestic like product in Pakistan; and  \n \n(vii) such other person or group of persons as the Commission may, by \nnotification in the official Gazette, specify;  \n \n(k)  “investigated product ” means a product which is subject to an anti­dumping \ninvestigation as described in the notice of initiation of the investigation;  \n \n(l)  “investigat ion” means an investigation conducted under this Act;  \n \n(m) “like product ” means a product which is alike in all respects to an investigated \nproduct or, in the absence of such a product, another product which, although \nnot alike in all respects, has characteristics closely resembling those of the \ninvestigated product;  \n \n(n)  “Normal value ” means normal value determined in accordance with Part III of \nthis Act;  \n \n(o)  “prescribed ” means prescribed by rules made under this Act; and  \n \n(p)  “WTO ” means the World Trade Organisation established pursuant to the \nMarrakesh  Agreement concluded  in Marrakesh, Morocco, on the 15th of April, \n1994.  \n \nPART II  \n \nANTI­DUMPING MEASURES  \n \n3. Levy of anti­dumping duty .—(1) The Commission shall, by notification in the official \nGazette, impose anti­dumping measures on products imported into Pakistan when it de termines, \npursuant to an investigation initiated and conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Act \nthat— \n \n(a)  an investigated product is dumped within the meaning of this Act; and  \n \n(b)  injury is being caused to domestic industry within the mean ing of this Act.  \n \nPage 9 of 39 \n PART III  \n \nIDENTIFICATION OF DUMPING AND DETERMINATION OF NORMAL VALUE  \n \n4. Identification of dumping .— For the purposes of this Act an investigated product shall be \nconsidered to be dumped if it is introduced into the commerce of Pakistan a t a price which is less than \nits normal value.  \n \n5. Normal value based on prices in exporting country .— (1) Save as provided for in section \n6, the Commission shall establish normal value of an investigated product on the basis of comparable \nprice paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, for sales of a like product when destined for \nconsumption in an exporting country.  \n \n  (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub­section (1), the Commission may establish \nnormal value of an investigated product on the basis of comparable price paid or payable in the ordinary \ncourse of trade for sales of a like product when destined for consumption in the country of origin of \nthe investigated product if — \n \n(a)  such products are not produced in an exporting countr y; or \n \n(b)  there is no comparable price for them in an exporting country.  \n \n(3) In the event the Commission decides to establish normal value on the basis of the country \nof origin of an investigated product pursuant to sub­section (2), any reference to an exporting country \nin this Act shall be deemed to refer to the country of origin of the investigated product.  \n \n6. Normal value based on export price to a third country or on constructed value .—(1) \nWhen there are no sales of a like product in the ordinary co urse of trade in domestic market of an \nexporting country, or when such sales do not permit a proper comparison because of any particular \nmarket situation or low volume of the sales in the domestic market of the exporting country, the \nCommission shall estab lish normal value of an investigated product on the basis of either — \n \n(a)  a comparable price of the like product when exported to an appropriate third \ncountry provided that this price is representative; or  \n \n(b)  the cost of production in the exporting co untry plus a reasonable amount for \nadministrative, selling and general costs and for profits.  \n \n(2) Sales of the like product destined for consumption in the domestic market of the exporting \ncountry or sales to an appropriate third country shall normally be  considered to be a sufficient quantity \nfor the determination of normal value if such sales constitute five per cent or more of the sales of the \ninvestigated product to Pakistan  : \n \nProvided that, if such sales constitute less than five per cent of the sale s of the investigated \nproduct to Pakistan, the Commission shall accept a lower ratio if, on the basis of evidence submitted \nby interested parties or otherwise available to it, it is satisfied that sales at such lower ratio are \nnonetheless of sufficient mag nitude to provide for a proper comparison.  \n \n \n \n \nPage 10 of 39 \n 7. Circumstances in which certain sales may be disregarded in determining normal \nvalue. —(1) The Commission may treat sales of a like product in domestic market of an exporting \ncountry or sales to a third countr y at prices below per unit, fixed and variable, cost of production plus \nadministrative, selling and other costs as not being in the ordinary course of trade by reason of price \nand may disregard such sales  in determining normal value only if the Commission determines that \nsuch sales were made­  \n \n(a)  within an extended period of time which shall no rmally be a period of one year \nand in no case less than a period of six months;  \n \n(b)  in substantial quantities; and  \n \n(c)  at prices which do not provide for the recovery of all costs within a reasonable \nperiod of time.  \n \n(2) For the purposes of sub­clause (b) of sub­section (1), sales below per unit cost shall be \ndeemed to be in substantial quantities if the Commission establishes that — \n \n(a)  a weighted average sel ling price of transactions under consideration for the \ndetermination of normal value is below a weighted average cost; or  \n \n(b)  the volume of sales below per unit cost represents twenty per cent or more of \nthe volume sold in transactions under consideratio n for the determination of \nnormal value.  \n \n(3) If prices which are below per unit cost at the time of sale are above the weighted average \ncost for the period of investigation, the Commission shall consider such prices as providing for \nrecovery of costs with in a reasonable period of time.  \n \n8. Calculation of costs for the purposes of sections 6 and 7 .— (1) For the purposes of \nsections 6 and 7, the Commission shall normally calculate costs on the basis of records kept by an \nexporter or a producer under investig ation provided that such records are in accordance with the \ngenerally accepted accounting principles of an exporting country and reasonably reflect the costs \nassociated with the production and sale of a like product.  \n \n(2) For the purposes of sections 6 and  7, the amounts for administrative, selling and general \ncosts and for profits shall be based on actual data pertaining to production and sales in the ordinary \ncourse of trade of a like product for consumption in an exporting country by any exporter or prod ucer \nunder investigation:  \n \nProvided that where the Commission is satisfied that such amounts cannot be determined on \nthe basis set out in sub­section (2), the amounts may be determined on the basis of — \n \n(a)  the actual amounts incurred and realised by an exporter or a producer in question \nin respect of production and sales in domestic market of an exporting country \nof the same general category of products;  \n \n(b)  the weighted average of the actual amounts incurred and realised by other \nexporters or producer s subject to investigation in respect of production and sales \nof a like product in domestic market of an exporting country; or  \n \nPage 11 of 39 \n (c)  any other reasonable method provided that the amount for profit so established \nshall not exceed the profit normally realised  by other exporters or producers on \nsales of products of the same general category in domestic market of an \nexporting country of a like product.  \n \n(3) The Commission shall consider all available evidence on the proper allocation of costs, \nincluding such information as is made available by any exporter or producer of a like product in the \ncourse of an investigation provided that such allocations have been historically utilised by the exporter \nor producer, in relation to establishing appropriate amortisatio n and depreciation periods and \nallowances for capital expenditures and other development cost, as the case may be.  \n \n   (4) Unless already reflected in the cost allocations under this section, the Commission shall \nadjust costs appropriately for those non­re curring items of cost which benefit either future or current \nproduction or both, or, for circumstances in which costs during the period of investigation are affected \nby start­up operations. Such adjustment made for start­up operations shall reflect the cos ts at the end \nof the start­up period or, if that period extends beyond the period of investigation, the most recent costs \nwhich can reasonably be taken into account by the Commission during the investigation.  \n \n9. Exports from a country in which the governm ent exercises sufficient control over \neconomic decisions so that the domestic market does not operate freely .—(1) Where the \nCommission determines that the government of an exporting country exercises sufficient control over \neconomic decisions so that domes tic market of such exporting country does not operate freely, the \nCommission may, determine normal value on the basis of — \n \n(a) a comparable price paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, for sales of \na like product when destined for consumption i n an appropriate market economy \ncountry;  \n \n(b)  where the Commission determines that the provisions of clause (a) cannot be \napplied, a comparable price paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, for \nexports of a like product from an appropriate marke t economy country to other \ncountries, including Pakistan;  \n \n(c)  where the Commission determines that the provisions of clauses (a) and (b) may \nnot be applied, a price actually paid or payable in Pakistan for a domestic like \nproduct, duly adjusted if necess ary to include a profit margin corresponding to \nthe margin to be expected under the existing economic circumstances for the \nsector concerned; or  \n \n(d)  where the Commission determines that the provisions of clauses (a), (b) and (c) \nmay not be applied, any o ther reasonable basis.  \n \n(2) In identifying an appropriate market economy country for the purposes of sub­ section (1), \nthe Commission shall take into account factors such as — \n \n(a)  similarity of the product in terms of materials and end use;  \n \n(b)  similarity of production methods; and  \n \n(c)  availability of necessary information to the Commission.  \n \nPage 12 of 39 \n PART IV  \n \nDETERMINATION OF EXPORT PRICE  \n \n10. Export price .—(1) Save as provided for in sub­sections (2) and (3), an export price shall \nbe a price actually paid or payable for an investigated product when sold for export from an exporting \ncountry to Pakistan.  \n \n(2) In cases where there is no export price or where it appears to the Commission that an export \nprice is unreliable because of association or a compen satory arrangement between an exporter and an \nimporter or a third party — \n \n(a)  the export price may be constructed on the basis of a price at which imported \nproducts are first resold to an independent buyer; or  \n \n(b)  if the imported products are not resold  to an independent buyer, or not resold in \nthe condition as imported, on such reasonable basis as the Commission may \ndetermine.  \n \n(3) Where, the Commission determines normal value on the basis of the country of origin \npursuant to sub­section (2) of section 5, an export price shall be a price actually paid or payable, as \ndetermined by the Commission, for an investigated product when sold for export in the country of \norigin of the investigated product.  \n \nPART V  \n \nCOMPARISON BETWEEN NORMAL VALUE AND EXPORT PRICE  \n \n11. Comparison .—(1) To ensure a fair comparison between export price and normal value, \nthe Commission shall, where possible, compare export price and normal value with the same \ncharacteristics in terms of level of trade, time of sale, quantities, taxes, p hysical characteristics, \nconditions and terms of sale and for delivery at the same place which shall normally be at ex­factory \nlevel. Where an interested party demonstrates to the Commission that any of the factors set out in this \nsubsection or any other factors identified by such interested party affect price comparability, the \nCommission shall make due allowance for differences in such factors to the extent that the same affect \nprice comparability.  \n \n(2) In cases where export price is constructed on the b asis of a price at which imported products \nare first resold to an independent buyer pursuant to sub­clause (a) of sub­section (2) of section 10, \nallowances for costs including duties and taxes incurred between importation and resale, and a \nreasonable amoun t for profits accruing, may also be made. If in such cases price comparability has \nbeen affected, the Commission shall establish normal value at a level of trade equivalent to a level of \ntrade of a constructed export price, or shall make due allowance as w arranted under this section.  \n \n(3) The Commission shall indicate to the parties in question what information is necessary to \nensure a fair comparison and shall not impose an unreasonable burden of proof on those parties.  \n \n12. Comparison methods .—(1) Subject to section 11, existence of dumping margin shall \nnormally be established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value with a \n \nPage 13 of 39 \n weighted average of prices of all comparable export transactions or by a comparison of normal valu e \nand export prices on a transaction­to­ transaction basis.  \n \n(2) Normal value established on a weighted average basis may be compared to prices of \nindividual export transactions if — \n \n(a)  the Commission finds a pattern of export prices, which differs signi ficantly \namong different purchasers, regions or time periods; and  \n \n(b)  the Commission provides an explanation as to why such differences cannot be \ntaken into account appropriately by the use of a weighted average­to­weighted \naverage or transaction­to­tran saction comparison.  \n \n 13. Currency conversion .—(1) Should the price comparison under sections 11 and 12 require \na conversion of currencies, the Commission shall make such conversion using the rate of exchange on \nthe date of sale.  \n \n(2) Fo r the purposes of s ub­section (1 ) the date of sale shall normally be the date of contract, \npurchase order, order confirmation or invoice, whichever establishes the material terms of sale.  \n \n(3) Notwithstanding anything in sub­sections (1) and (2), when a sale of foreign curre ncy on \nforward markets is used in direct relation to an export sale, the Commission shall use the rate of \nexchange in the forward sale for all the related transactions.  \n \n(4) The Commission shall ignore fluctuations in exchange rates and shall allow exporte rs at \nleast sixty days to have adjusted their export prices to reflect sustained movements in exchange rates \nduring the period of investigation.  \n \n14. Individual dumping margin .—(1) The Commission shall determine an individual \ndumping margin for each known exporter or producer of an investigated product.  \n \n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub­section (1), where the Commission is satisfied \nthat the number of exporters, producers or importers, or types of products involved is so large as to \nmake it imp racticable to determine an individual dumping margin for each known exporter or producer \nconcerned of an investigated product, the Commission may limit its examination to a reasonable \nnumber of interested parties or investigated products by using samples w hich are statistically valid on \nthe basis of information available to the Commission at the time of selection, or to the largest \npercentage of volume of exports from the country in question which can reasonably be investigated.  \n \n(3) The selection of export ers, producers, importers or types of products shall normally be made \nby the Commission in consultation with the exporters, producers or importers concerned:  \n \nProvided that the final selection of the exporters, producers, importers or types of products \nshall rest with the Commission.  \n \n(4) In cases where the Commission has limited its examination as provided for in sub­sections \n(2) and (3), the Commission shall nevertheless determine an individual dumping margin for any \nexporter or producer who voluntarily submits the necessary information in time for that information \nto be considered during the course of an investigation:  \n \n \nPage 14 of 39 \n Provided that where the Commission determines that the number of exporters or producers is \nso large that individual examinations would b e unduly burdensome to the Commission and prevent the \ntimely completion of the investigation, the Commission may decline to determine an individual \ndumping margin on the basis of such voluntary responses and limit its examination to such exporters \nand prod ucers selected pursuant to sub­section (2).  \n \nPART VI -DETERMINATION OF INJURY  \n15. Determination of injury .— (1) A determination of injury, for the purposes of this Act \nshall be based on an objective examination of all relevant factors by the Commission which shall \ninclude but shall not be limited to — \n \n(a)  volume of dumped imports;  \n \n(b)  effect of dumped imports on prices in domestic market for like products; and  \n \n(c)  consequent impact of dumped imports on domestic producers of such products.  \n \n(2) With  regard to volume of dumped imports, the Commission shall consider whether there \nhas been a significant increase in dumped imports, either in absolute terms or relative to production or \nconsumption in Pakistan.  \n \n(3) With regard to effect of dumped imports on prices in domestic market, the Commission \nshall consider whether — \n \n(a)  there has been a significant price undercutting by the dumped imports as \ncompared with price of a domestic like product; or  \n \n(b)  whether the effect of dumped imports is otherwise t o depress prices to a \nsignificant degree or prevent price increases, which otherwise would have \noccurred, to a significant degree.  \n \n(4) No one or several of the factors identified in sub­section (2) or (3) shall be deemed to \nnecessarily give decisive guidance and the Commission may take into account such other factors as it \nconsiders relevant for the determination of injury.  \n \n(5) In circumstances where domestic industry in relation to a product in question has been \ndivided into two or more competitive markets, and producers within each such market are regarded as \na separate industry under the second proviso to the explanation to clause (e) of section 2, injury may \nbe found to exist even where a major portion of the total domestic industry does not suffe r injury \nprovided that, there is a concentration of dumped imports into such a market, and provided further that \ndumped imports are causing injury to the producers of all or almost all of the production within such \nmarket.  \n \n16. Cumulation .— Where imports o f a like product from more than one country are the subject \nof simultaneous investigations under this Act the Commission may cumulatively assess the effects of \nsuch imports on domestic industry only if it determines that — \n \n(a)  dumping margin in relation t o an investigated product from each country is \nmore than the negligible amount as specified in clause (a) of subsection (3) of \n \nPage 15 of 39 \n section 41, and volume of dumped imports from each investigated country is \nnot less than the negligible quantity as specified in clause (b) of sub­section (3) \nof section 41; and  \n \n (b)  a cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports is appropriate in the light \nof— \n \n(i)  the conditions of competition between the imports; and  \n \n(ii)  the conditions of competition between the impo rts and a domestic like \nproduct.  \n \n17. Examination of impact of dumped imports on domestic industry .—(1) An examination \nof impact of dumped imports on domestic industry concerned shall include an evaluation by the \nCommission of all relevant economic factors  and indices having a bearing on the state of the domestic \nindustry, including, but not limited to — \n \n(a)  actual and potential decline in sales, profits, output, market share, productivity, \nreturn on investments, or utilisation of capacity;  \n \n(b)  factors a ffecting domestic prices;  \n \n(c)  magnitude of dumping margin; and  \n \n(d)  actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, \nwages, growth, ability to raise capital or investments.  \n \nExplanation. —The list of factors specified in sub­section (1) shall not be exhaustive, nor shall \none or several of these factors be deemed to necessarily give decisive guidance.  \n  \n(2) The Commission shall assess effect of dumped imports in relation to production of a \ndomestic like product in Pakistan when available data permit separate identification of that production \non the basis of criteria of production process, producer ’s sales and profits:  \n \nProvided that if such separate identification of that production is not possible, the Commission \nshall asse ss effects of dumped imports by examination of the production of the narrowest group or \nrange of products, which includes a domestic like product, for which necessary information can be \nprovided.  \n \n18. Causation .—(1) The Commission shall satisfy itself that  dumped imports are, through the \neffects of dumping, as provided in sections 15 and 17, causing injury within the meaning of this Act. \nThe consideration of a causal relationship between dumped imports and injury to domestic industry \nshall be based on an ex amination by the Commission of all relevant evidence before it.  \n \n(2) The Commission shall examine any known factors other than dumped imports which are \ninjuring domestic industry and injuries caused by such other factors shall not be attributed by the \nComm ission to the dumped imports.  \n \n(3) Factors which may be relevant for the purposes of an examination by the Commission \npursuant to sub­section (2) may include the following, namely: — \n \nPage 16 of 39 \n  \n(a)  volume and price of imports not sold at dumping prices;  \n \n(b) contrac tion in demand or changes in the patterns of consumption;  \n \n(c)  trade restrictive practices of and competition between foreign and domestic \nproducers;  \n \n(d) developments in technology; and  \n \n(e) export performance and productivity of domestic industry.  \n \n19. Threat of material injury. — (1) In making a determination regarding existence of a threat \nof material injury, the Commission shall consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to, such \nfactors as — \n \n(a)  a significant rate of increase of dumped imports into domestic market indicating \nthe likelihood of substantially increased importation;  \n \n(b)  sufficient freely disposable, or an imminent and substantial increase in capacity \nof an exporter indicating the likelihood of substantially increased dumpe d \nexports to market in Pakistan, taking into account the availability of other export \nmarkets to absorb any additional exports;  \n \n(c)  whether imports are entering at prices that shall have a significant depressing or \nsuppressing effect on prices in Pakista n, and would likely increase demand for \nfurther imports; and  \n \n(d)  inventories of an investigated product.  \n \n(2) No one factor specified in sub­section (1) shall by itself, be deemed to necessarily give \ndecisive guidance and in making a determination regard ing a threat of material injury the Commission \nshall, on the basis of the totality of the factors considered, satisfy itself that further dumped exports are \nimminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury shall occur.  \n \nPART VII  \n \nINITIATION AND CONDUCT OF INVESTIGATIONS  \n \n20. Requirement of a written application .—(1) Subject to section 24 and save as provided \nfor in section 25, an investigation by the Commission shall only be initiated upon a written application \nby or on behalf of d omestic industry.  \n \n(2) An application under sub­section (1) shall — \n \n(a)  be submitted to the Commission in such manner, number and form and with \nsuch fee as may be prescribed;  \n \n \nPage 17 of 39 \n (b)  include evidence of dumping and injury within the meaning of this Act and the \ncausal link between the dumped imports and the alleged injury, as is reasonably \navailable to the applicant; and  \n \n(c)  contain such further information as may be prescribed.  \n \n 21.

Mandatory imposition of anti­dumping duty .— (1) When the Commission has \nestablished the existence of dumping and injury in ac cordance with the provisions of this Act, it shall, \nby notification in the official Gazette, impose an anti­dumping duty.  \n \n(2) The amount of the anti­dumping duty shall not exceed the margin of dumping established \nbut it may be less than the margin if such  lesser duty would be adequate to remove injury to the \nDomestic Industry.  \n \n51. Imposition and collection of anti­dumping duties .— (1) Anti -dumping duties, whether \nprovisional or definitive, as the case may be, imposed under this Act shall — \n \n(a)  take the form of ad valorem  or specific duties:  \n \nProvided that provisional measures shall take the form of security by way of \ncash deposit;  \n \n(b)  be imposed in addition to other import duties levied on an investigated product;  \n \n(c)  be collected in the same manner as customs­duties under the Customs Act, \n1969 (IV of  1969) 2[:] \n \n  2[Provided that where competent court of law has stayed preliminary or \nfinal determination of anti -dumping duty, goods shall be provisionally released \nagainst security in shape of bank guarantee or pay order of a scheduled bank along \nwith indemnity bond equ al to the amount of anti -dumping duty imposed on the \nsubject goods.

If the \npreliminary or final determination is set aside by the court, security shall be \nreleased, if not required for recovery of any outstanding previous liability 3[;]] 1[or] \n \n(d)  be levied and collected on a non­ discriminatory basis on imports of such product \nfrom all sources found to be dumped and causing injury, except as to imports \nfrom those sources from which price undertakings have been accepted by the \nCommission in accordance  with the provisions of Part XII  of this Act  3[; or] \n \n1[(e) * * * * * * *]  \n \n3[(ea)  not be levied on impots that are to be used as inputs in products destined solely \nfor export or for use in the foreign grant -in-aid projects and are covered under \nany scheme exempting customs duties for exports or foreign grant -in-aid \nprojects under the Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969) ] \n \n(2) Save as pro vided for in sub­section (3), the Commission shall establish an individual \nanti­dumping duty for each known exporter or producer of dumped imports.  \n \n(3) Subject to sub­sections (4) and (7), where the Commission has limited its examination of \ndumping margin  in accordance with sub­sections (2) and (3) of section 14, any anti­dumping duty \napplied to imports from exporters or producers not included in an examination by the Commission \nshall not exceed a weighted average dumping margin established with respect to  selected exporters or \nproducers.  \n \n1Added & Omitted by The Finance Act, 2019 (V of 2019), s.15.  \n2Added by  The Finance Act, 2020 (XIX of 2020 ), s. 8.  \n3Subs, and Added by the Act. of The Anti -Dumping Duties (Amdt) Act, 2022 (XXIX of 2022) , s. 3.  \n \nPage 28 of 39 \n (4) The Commission shall disregard for the purposes of sub­section (3) any negligible margins, \nas defined in sub­section (3) of section 41, and margins established under the circumstances referred \nto in section 32.  \n \n(5) Save as provided for in sub­section (4) of s ection 14, the Commission shall apply individual \nanti­dumping duties to imports from any exporter or producer not included in an examination who has \nprovided the necessary information during the course of an investigation.  \n \n(6) The Commission may apply a r esidual anti­dumping duty rate for imports from exporters \nand producers not known to the Commission at time of final determination at a rate which shall not \nexceed a weighted average of individual dumping margins established for exporters and producers \nexamined during an investigation, excluding margins established in accordance with section 32.  \n \n(7) Where all dumping margins are established pursuant to section 32, the Commission shall \nuse such alternative method of determining dumping margins for exporters  or producers not included \nin its examination as it considers reasonable in the circumstances.  \n \n52. Refund of anti­dumping duties paid in excess of dumping margin .—(1) An importer \nshall be granted a refund of the actual amount of anti­dumping duties collec ted if the Commission \ndetermines that dumping margin, on the basis of which such anti­dumping duties were paid, has been \neliminated or reduced to a level which is below the level of the anti­dumping duty in force.  \n \n(2) An importer may submit an application  for refund of anti­dumping duties collected within \nany twelve months period to the Commission not later than sixty days from the end of such period.  \n \n(3) An application under sub­section (2) shall contain such information as may be prescribed.  \n \nExplanation :—When investigating an application for refund under this section, the \nCommission shall apply the relevant provisions of this Act to its determinations. In particular, when \ndetermining whether and to what extent a refund should be made when an e xport price is constructed \non the basis of a price at which imported products are first resold to an independent buyer due to the \nabsence of export price or because it appears that the export price is unreliable pursuant to sub­section \n(2) of section 10, t he Commission shall take account of any change in normal value, any change of \ncosts incurred between importation and resale, and any movement in resale price which is duly \nreflected in subsequent selling prices, and shall calculate the export price with no  deduction for the \namount of anti­dumping duties paid when satisfactory evidence of the above is provided.  \n \n(4) The Commission shall provide an importer m aking an application under sub­ section (2) \nwith an explanation of the reasons for the decision concern ing a request for refund.  \n \n(5) A refund of anti­dumping duties under this section shall normally take place within twelve \nmonths, and in no case later than eighteen months, after the date on which an application for refund \ncompliant with the requirements o f subsection (3) is received by the Commission.  \n \n53. Anti­dumping and countervailing duties and fees to be held in a non­lapsable personal \nledger account .—(1) The Commission shall establish and maintain a non­lapsable personal ledger \naccount in its name for the purposes of Anti­Dumping Duties and Countervailing Duties.  \n \n(2) All anti­dumping and countervailing duties collected under the laws specified in sub­section  \n(1) shall be held in that account.  \n \n(3) The account established under sub­section (1) shall  be maintained and operated in such \nmanner as may be prescribed.  \n \nPage 29 of 39 \n PART XIV  \n \nRETROACTIVITY  \n \n54. Retroactive application of definitive anti­dumping duties in certain circumstances .—\nA definitive anti­dumping duty may be collected on products, which were import ed for consumption \nnot more than ninety days prior to the date of application of provisional measures if, the Commission  \ndetermines, for a dumped product in question, that:  \n \n(a)  there is a history of dumping which caused injury or that the importer was, o r \nshould have been, aware that the exporter practices dumping and that such \ndumping would cause injury; and  \n \n(b)  injury is caused by massive dumped imports of a product in a relatively short \ntime which in the light of timing and volume of dumped imports a nd other \ncircumstances including, but not limited to, a rapid build­up of inventories of \nthe imported product, is likely to seriously undermine the remedial effect of the \ndefinitive anti­dumping duty to be applied, provided that the importers \nconcerned hav e been given an opportunity of being heard in respect of such \nproposed action.  \n \n55. Imposition of definitive anti­dumping duties retroactively .— (1) Where the \nCommission makes a final determination of injury but not of a threat thereof or of material retar dation \nof the establishment of an industry or, in the case of a final determination of a threat of injury, where \nthe Commission determines that the effect of dumped imports would, in the absence of provisional \nmeasures, have led to a determination of injur y, definitive anti­ dumping duties may be levied \nretroactively for the period for which provisional measures, if any, have been applied.  \n \n(2) If definitive anti­dumping duty imposed under sub­section (1) is higher than the amount of \nprovisionally determined  dumping margin se t forth in the notice of prelim inary determination referred \nto in sub­section (2) of section 37, the difference shall not be collected, and if such definitive \nanti­dumping duty is lower than the amount of such provisionally determined dum ping margin the \ndifference shall be refunded by the Commission within forty­five days of such determination.  \n \n(3) Save as provided for in sub­section (1), where the Commission makes a determination of \nthreat of injury or material retardation, but no injury  has yet occurred, definitive anti­dumping duties \nmay be imposed only from the date of the determination of threat of injury or material retardation and \nany cash deposit made during the period of application of provisional measures shall be refunded by \nthe Commission within forty­five days of such determination.  \n \n(4) Where the Commission makes a negative final determination, any cash deposit made during \nthe period of application of provisional measures shall be refunded by the Commission within forty­ \nfive days of such determination.  \n \n56. Circumstances in which provisional measures and anti­dumping duties shall apply .— \nSave as provided for in sections 49, 54 and 55, provisional measures and definitive anti­dumping duties \nshall only be applied to products which enter into Pakistan for consumption on or after the date of \npublication of a notice of affirmative preliminary or final determination in an investigation.  \n \n \n \nPage 30 of 39 \n PART XV  \n \nDURATION AND REVIEW OF ANTI­DUMPING DUTIES AND PRICE UNDERTAKINGS  \n \n57. Duration of a nti­dumping duty .—Subject to the provisions of this Act any anti­dumping \nduty imposed under this Act shall remain in force only as long as and to the extent necessary to \ncounteract dumping, which is causing injury.  \n \n58.

Review for change of circumstances .— (1) The Commission shall review the need for \ncontinued imposition of ant i­dumping duty, where warranted, on its own initiative or, provided that a \nperiod of twenty­four months has elapsed since the imposition of definitive anti­dumping duty, upon \na written request submitted by any interested party, which contains positive info rmation substantiating \nthe occurrence of changed circumstances justifying a need for a review including sufficient \ninformation to enable the Commission to cal culate export price and normal  value of a product in \nquestion.  \n \n(2) The Commission shall, upon ini tiation of a review under sub­section (1), publish a notice \nin the official Gazette and in at least one issue each of a daily newspaper in the English language and \na daily newspaper in the Urdu language having wide circulation in Pakistan.  \n \n(3) In undertak ing a review under sub­section (1), the Commission shall consider whether \ncontinued imposition of anti­dumping duty is necessary to offset dumping and whether injury would \nbe likely to continue to recur if anti­dumping duty were removed or varied and if, a s a result, the \nCommission determines that continued imposition of anti­ dumping duty is no longer warranted it shall \nbe terminated immediately.  \n \n(4) The Commission may require an applicant requesting a review under this section to fill in \nan additional qu estionnaire provided by it requiring such information and for such period as the \nCommission deems necessary before such review is initiated in which case the review shall be initiated \nfollowing the receipt by the Commission of such questionnaire duly fille d in. \n \n60. Newcomer review .—(1) If a product  is subject to definitive anti­ dumping duties, the \nCommission shall carry out a review for the purpose of determining individual dumping margins for \nany exporters or producers in an exporting country concerned wh o did not export the product to \n \nPage 31 of 39 \n Pakistan during the period of investigation if such exporters or producers can show that they are not \nrelated to any of the exporters or producers in the exporting country who are subject to the anti­ \ndumping duties on an in vestigated product.  \n \n(2) A review under sub­section (1) shall be initiated within thirty days following the date of \nreceipt of an application for such review by any producer or exporter concerned and shall normally be \ncompleted within six months from its initiation and, in any event, no later than twelve months:  \n \nProvided that the Commission may require an applicant requesting a review under sub­section \n(1) to fill in an additional questionnaire provided by it requiring such information and for such period  \nas the Commission deems necessary before such review is initiated in which case a review under sub­ \nsection (1) shall be initiated within thirty days following the receipt by the Commission of such \nquestionnaire duly filled in.  \n \n(3) No anti­dumping measur es shall be imposed on imports from any exporters or producers \nreferred to in sub­section (1) while the review under sub -section (2) is being carried out:  \n \nProvided that the Commission may require a cash deposit in the amount of the residual anti­ \ndumping duty rate determined pursuant to sub­section (5) of section 5 1 to ensure that, should such a  \nreview result in a determination of dumping in respect of such producers or exporters, anti­dumping \nduties can be levied retroactively to the date of initiation of  the review.  \n \n61.

Anti­dumping duties not \nexceeding the residual anti­dumping duty imposed in accordance with section 39 m ay be extended to \nimports from companies benefiting from individual duties in the countries subject to measures when \ncircumvention of the measures in force is taking place. Circumvention shall be defined as a change in \nthe pattern of trade between third co untries and Pakistan or between individual companies in the \ncountry subject to measures by Pakistan, which stems from a practice, process or work for which there \nis insufficient due cause or economic justification other than the imposition of the duty, and  where \nthere is evidence of injury or that the remedial effects of the duty are being undermined in terms of the \nprices or quantities of the like product, and where there is evidence of dumping in relation to the normal \nvalues previously established for th e like product, if necessary in accordance with the provisions of \nthis Act.  \n \n(2) The practice, process or work referred to in sub­section (1) includes, inter alia , the slight \nmodification of the product concerned to make it fall under customs tariff which are normally not \nsubject to the measures, provided that the modification does not alter its essential characteristics, the \nconsignment of the product subject to measures via third countries, the re­organisation by exporters or \n \nPage 32 of 39 \n producers of their patterns a nd channels of sales in the country subject to measures in order to \neventually have their products exported to Pakistan through producers benefiting from an individual \nduty rate lower than that applicable to the products of the manufacturers, and, in the c ircumstances \nindicated in sub­section (3), the assembly of parts by an assembly operation in Pakistan or a third \ncountry.  \n \n(3) An assembly operation in Pakistan or a third country shall be considered to circumve nt the \nmeasures in force where, — \n \n(a)  the op eration started or substantially increased since, or just prior to, the \ninitiation of the anti­dumping investigation and the parts concerned are from the \ncountry subject to measures;  \n \n(b)  the parts constitute 60 % or more of the total value of the parts o f the assembled \nproduct, except that in no case shall circumvention be considered to be taking \nplace where the value added to the parts brought in, during the assembly or \ncompletion operation, is greater than 25 % of the manufacturing cost;  \n \n(c)  the remed ial effects of the duty are being undermined in terms of the prices or \nquantities of the assembled like product and there is evidence of dumping in \nrelation to the normal values previously established for the like or similar \nproducts.  \n \n(4) Investigations shall be initiated pursuant to this section on the initiative of the Commission \nor at the request of any interested party on the basis of sufficient evidence regarding the factors set out \nin sub­sections (1) and (2).

As soon as possible after initiation of an investigation, the Commission should specify in \ndetail the information required from any interested party, and the manner in which that information \nshould be structured by the interested party in its response. Th e Commission should also ensure that \nthe interested party is aware that if information is not supplied within a reasonable time, the \nCommission shall be free to make determination on the basis of facts available, including those \ncontained in an application  for initiation of an investigation by domestic industry.  \n \n2. The Commission may also request an interested party to provide its response in a particular \nmedium such as computer tape or computer language. Where such a request is made, the Commission \nshould  consider the reasonable ability of the interested party to respond in the preferred medium or \ncomputer language, and should not request the party to use for its response a computer system other \nthan that used by the party. The Commission should not mainta in a request for a computerised response \nif the interested party does not maintain computerised accounts and if presenting the response as \nrequested would result in an unreasonable extra burden on the interested party or it would entail \nunreasonable additi onal cost and trouble. The Commission should not maintain a request for a response \nin a particular medium or computer language if the interested party does not maintain its computerised \naccounts in such medium or computer language and if presenting the res ponse as requested would \nresult in an unreasonable extra burden on the interested party or it would entail unreasonable additional \ncost and trouble.  \n \n3. All information which is verifiable, which is appropriately submitted so that it can be used \nin an inve stigation without undue difficulties, which is supplied in a timely fashion, and, where \n \nPage 39 of 39 \n applicable, which is supplied in a medium or computer language requested by the Commission, should \nbe taken into account when determinations are made. If a party does n ot respond in the preferred \nmedium or computer language but the Commission finds that the circumstances set out in para 2 have \nbeen satisfied, any failure to respond in the preferred medium or computer language shall not be \nconsidered to significantly impe de the investigation.  \n \n4. Where the Commission does not have the ability to process information if provided in a \nparticular medium such as computer tape, the information should be supplied in the form of written \nmaterial or any other form acceptable to the  Commission.  \n \n5. If an information provided is not ideal in all respects, this shall not justify the Commission \nfrom disregarding it, provided an interested party has acted to the best of its ability.  \n \n6. If evidence or information is not accepted by the C ommission, the supplying party shall be \ninformed forthwith of the reasons therefore, and shall be given an opportunity to provide further \nexplanations within a reasonable period, as may be determined by the Commission, due account being \ntaken of the time­l imits of an investigation. If the explanations are considered by the Commission as \nnot being satisfactory, the reasons for rejection of such evidence or information should be given in any \npublished determinations.  \n \n7. If the Commission has to base its find ings, including those with respect to normal value, on \nany information from a secondary source, including any information supplied in an application for \ninitiation of an investigation, it shall do so with special circumspection. In such cases, the Commissi on \nshall, where practicable, check the information from other independent sources at their disposal, such \nas published price lists, official import statistics and customs returns, and from the information \nobtained from other interested parties during the i nvestigation provided that if an interested party does \nnot co­operate and thus relevant information is being withheld from the Commission, this situation \nmay lead to a result which is less favourable to the party than if the party did co­operate.  \n \n \n_______ ________"
