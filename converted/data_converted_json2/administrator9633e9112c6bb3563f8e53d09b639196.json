Since then, various amendments made in \nthe Constitution and experience gained over the time necessitated an in \ndepth revision of these Rules, therefore, the National Assembly passed the \nRules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, \n2007 on 23rdFebruary, 2007.\nOn the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee on \nconstitutional Reforms the Parliament made historic amendments in the \nConstitution by passing the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, \n2010.\nAfter the passage of these amendments in the Constitution, it was \nnecessary to amend the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the \nNational Assembly, 2007 to bring them in conformity with the amended \nConstitution.
