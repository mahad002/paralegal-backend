Act, 1870 (27 of 1870), s. 1, for the original section.  \n \n \nPage 37 of 179 \n  \n35. When such an act is criminal by reason of its being done with a criminal \nKnowle dge or intention .

Effect caused partly by act and partly by omissi on. Wherever the causing of a certain \neffect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood \nthat the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence.  \nIllustratio n \nA intentionally causes Z’s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly by \nbeating Z. A has committed murder.  \n37. Co­operation by doing one of several acts constituting an offence.  When an offence \nis committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally co­operates in the commission of that \noffence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that \noffence.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving  him small doses \nof poison. A and B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to \nmurder  Z. Z dies from the effects of the several doses of poison so administered to him. \nHere A and B intentionally co­operate in the commission of murder a nd as each of them \ndoes an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though \ntheir acts are separate.  \n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such, have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternately for \nsix hours at a time. A and B, intending to cause Z's death, knowingly co­operate in \ncausing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to \nfurnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B \nare guilty of the murder of Z.  \n(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A intending to cause Z's death, illegally \nomits to supply Z with food ; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, \nbut the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from h is office, \nand B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co­operation with A, illegally omits to \nsupply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z's death. Z dies of \nhunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co­operate with B, A is guil ty only of \nan attempt to commit murder.  \n38. Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences.  Where \nseveral persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of \ndifferent offences by means of that  act. \n  \n \nPage 38 of 179 \n Illustration  \nA attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only \nculpable homicide not amounting to murder. B having ill­will towards Z and intending to kill him, and \nnot having been subject to the provocat ion, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both \nengaged in causing Z’s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide.  \n39. “Voluntarily”.  A person is said to cause an effect “voluntarily” when he causes it by \nmeans whereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those means, he \nknew or had reason to believe to be likely to cause it.  \nIllustration  \nA sets fire, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of facilitating robbery \nand thus causes the death of a person. Here, A may not have intended to cause death, and may even be \nsorry that death has been caused by his act : yet, if he knew that he was likely to cause death, he has \ncaused death voluntarily.  \n1[40. “Offence.”  Except in the 2[chapters] and sections mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of this \nsection, the word \"offence\" denotes a thing made punishable by this Code.  \nIn Chapter IV, 3[Chapter VA] and in the following sections, namely, sections 4[64,] 4[65,] 4[66,] \n5[67,] 4[71,] 109, 1 10, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 187, 194, 195, 203, 211, 213, 214, 221, 222, 223, 224,  \n225, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 347, 348, 388, 389, and 445, the word \"offence\" denotes a thing \npunishable under this Code, or under any special or local law as h ereinafter defined.  \nAnd in sections 14 1, 176, 177, 201, 202, 212, 216 and 441 the word \"offence\" has the same \nmeaning when the thing punishable under the special or local law is punishable under such law with \nimprisonment for a term of six months or upward s, whether with or without fine.]  \n41. “Special law”.

If \nthe offence be punishable with fine only, 1[the imprisonment which the Court imposes in defa ult of \npayment of the fine shall be simple, and] the term for which the Court directs the offender to be \nimprisoned, in default of payment of fine, shall not exceed the following scale, that is to say, for any \nterm not exceeding two months when the amount of the fine shall not exceed fifty rupees, and for any \nterm not exceeding four months when the amount shall not exceed one hundred rupees, and for any \nterm not exceeding six months in any other case.  \n68. Imprisonment to terminate on payment of fine.  The imprisonment which is imposed \nin default of payment of a fine shall terminate whenever that fine is either paid or levied by process of \nlaw. \n69. Termination of imprisonment on payment of proportional part of fine.  If, before \nthe expiration of the term  of imprisonment fixed in default of payment, such a proportion of the fine \nbe paid or levied that the term of imprisonment suffered in default of payment is not less than \nproportional to the part of the fine still unpaid, the imprisonment shall terminate.  \nIllustration  \nA is sentenced to a fine of one hundred rupees and to four months' imprisonment in default of \npayment. Here, if seventy­five  rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one month \nof the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the first month has expired. If seventy­five rupees \nbe paid or levied at the time of the expiration of the first month, or at any later time while A continues \nin imprisonment, A will be immediately discharged. If fifty rupees of the fine be paid or levied before \nthe expiration of two months of the imprisonments, A will be discharged as soon as the two months \nare completed. If fifty r upees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration to those two months, or at \nany later time while A continues in imprisonment, A will be immediately discharged.  \n70. Fine leviable within six years, or during imprisonment.  Death not to discharge \nproperty  from liability.

Limit of punishment of offence made up of several o ffences.  Where anything which \nis an offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be \npunished with the punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided.  \n2[Where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in \nforce for the time being by which offences are defined or punished, or  \nwhere several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an \noffence, constitut e, when combined, a different offence,  \nthe offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries \nhim could award for anyone of such offences.]  \n \n1Ins. by the Indian Penal Code Amdt.

Here A may have committed the offence of \nvoluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which \nmake up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for ev ery blow, he might be \nimprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment \nfor the whole beating.  \n(b) But if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the \nblow given to Y is no part of th e act whereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable \nto one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow given \nto Y.  \n72. Punishment of person guilty of one of several offences, the judgment stating that \nit is doubtful of which.  In all cases in which judgment is given that a person is guilty of one of several \noffences specified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences he is guilty, the \noffender shall be punished for the offence for which the lowes t punishment is provided if the same \npunishment is not provided for all.  \n73. Solitary confinement.  Whenever any person is convicted of an offence for which under \nthis Code the Court has power to sentence him to rigorous imprisonment, the Court may, by its \nsentence, order that the offender shall be kept in solitary confinement for any portion or portions of \nthe imprisonment to which he is sentenced, not exceeding three months in the whole, according to the  \nfollowing scale, that is to say__ \na time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months :  \na time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months and  \n1[shall not exceed one] year :  \na time not exceeding three months if the term of  imprisonment shall exceed one year.  \n74.

Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing him -self bound, by \nlaw. Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact \nand not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A, a soldier, fires on a mob by the order of  his superior officer, in conformity with the \ncommands of the law. A has committed no offence.  \n(b) A, an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and, after \ndue enquiry, believing Z to be Y, arrests Z. A has committed no offe nce. \n77. Act of Judge when acting judicially.  Nothing is an offence which is done by a Judge \nwhen acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, \ngiven to him by law.  \n78. Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court.  Nothing which is done in \npursuance of, or which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court of Justice, if done whilst such \njudgment or order remains in force, is an offence, notwithstanding the Court may have had no \njurisdiction t o pass such judgment or order, provided the person doing the act in good faith believes \nthat the Court had such jurisdiction.  \n79. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified, by \nlaw. Nothing is an offence which is done  by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a \nmistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by \nlaw, in doing it.  \nIllustration  \nA sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his \njudgment, exerted in good faith of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending \nmurder s in the act, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper authorities. A has committed no \noffence, though it may turn  out that Z was acting in self­defence.  \n80. Accident in doing a lawful act.  Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or \nmisfortune, and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful \nmanner by lawful means and w ith proper care and caution.  \n \n1Clause (b) as amended by A. O., 1937, A. O., 1949, Ord. 21 of 1960, A.O., 1961 and F.A.O. 1975, have been omitted by the Fede ral Laws (Revision \nand Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s. 3 and II Sch.  \n2Subs. by the Law  Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s. 2 and Sch., for “transportation for life”.  \n \nPage 45 of 179 \n Illustration  \nA is at work with a hatchet ; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here if there \nwas no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an  offence.  \n81. Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other \nharm. Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to \ncause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose \nof preventing or avoiding other harm to person or  property.  \nExplanation.__ It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or  \navoided  was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the \nknowledge that it was likely to cause harm.  \n \nIllustrations  \n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his \npart, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must \ninevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he \nchanges the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of \nrunning down a boat C with only two pa ssengers on board, which he may possibly clear. \nHere, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good \nfaith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not \nguilty of an offence, though he ma y run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew \nwas likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which \nhe intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down \nC. \n(b) A, in a great fire, pu lls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from \nspreading. He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property. \nHere, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent \nas to excuse A’s a ct, A is not guilty of the offence.  \n82. Act of child under 1[ten]  years of age.  Nothing is an offence which is done by a child \nunder  1[ten] years of age.  \n83. Act of a child above 1[ten]  and under 1[fourteen] of immature understanding.  \nNothing is an offence which is done by a child above 1[ten] years of age and under 1[fourteen], who \nhas not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his \nconduct on that occasion.  \n84. Act of a person of unsou nd mind.  Nothing is an offence which is done by a person \nwho, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of \nthe act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.  \n \n1Subs. by Act X (Second Amdt.) of 2016, s. 2 and 3.  \n  \n \nPage 46 of 179 \n 85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his \nwill. Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of  \nintoxication, incapable of knowing the  nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or \ncontrary to law: provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his \nknowledge or against his will.  \n86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge commit ted by one who is \nintoxicated.  In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or \nintent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had \nthe same knowledge as he would  have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which \nintoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.  \n87. Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done \nby consent.  Nothing wh ich is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known \nby the doer to be likely to cause death, or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it \nmay cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighte en years of age, who has \ngiven consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm ; or by reason of any harm which it may \nbe known by the doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of \nthat harm.  \nIllustration  \nA an d Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of \neach to suffer any harm which in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if \nA, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.  \n88. Act not  intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person’s benefit.  \nNothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, \nor be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely t o cause, to any person for \nwhose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to \nsuffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm.  \nIllustration  \nA, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to c ause the death of Z, who suffers \nunder the painful complaint, but not intending to cause Z’s death, and intending, in good faith Z’s \nbenefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z’s consent. A has committed no offence.  \n89. Act done in good faith for benefit  of child or insane person, by or by consent of \nguardian . Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, \nor of unsound mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having \nlawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended \nby the doer to cause or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person:  \nProvisos.  Provided — \nFirst .__ That this exception shall not extend to the  intentional causing of death, or to the  \nattempting to cause death ;  \nSecondly .__ That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing \nit knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death o r grievous \n \nPage 47 of 179 \n hurt; or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity ;  \nThirdly .__ That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to \nthe attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death o r grievous hurt, \nor the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity ;  \nFourthly .__ That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the \ncommitting  of which offence it would not extend.  \nIllustration  \nA, in good faith, for his child’s benefit without his child’s consent, has his child cut for the stone \nby a surgeon, knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the child’s death, but not intending to \ncause the child’s death. A is within the exception, inasmuch as his object was the cure of the  child.  \n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception. A consent is not such a \nconsent as is intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of \ninjury, or under a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, \nthat the consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception ;  or \nConsent of insane person . if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, \nor intoxication,  is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his \nconsent; or  \nConsent of child. unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a \nperson who is under twelve years of  age. \n91. Exclusion of acts which a re offences independently of harm caused.  The exceptions \nin sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which \nthey may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the  \nconsent, or on whose behalf the consent is given.  \nIllustration  \nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the \nwoman) is an offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the \nwoma n. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”, and the consent of the woman or of \nher guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act.  \n92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.  Nothing is an offe nce \nby reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even \nwithout that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to \nsignify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person \nin lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done \nwith benefit:  \nProviso.  Provided — \nFirst.__ That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or the attempting \nto cause death;  \nSecondly.__ That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing \n \nPage 48 of 179 \n it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purp ose other than the preventing of death or grievous \nhurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;  \nThirdly.__ That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the  \nattempting to cause hurt, for any purpose other than th e preventing of death or hurt ;  \nFourthly .__ That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the  \ncommitting of which offence it would not extend.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be \ntrepanned. A not intending Z’s death but in good faith for Z’s benefit, performs the \ntrepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed no offence.  \n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may \nkill Z, but not intending to kill Z, and in good faith intending Z’s benefit. A’s ball gives \nZ a mortal wound. A has committed no offence.  \n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal un less an \noperation be immediately performed. There is no time to apply to the child’s guardian. \nA performs the operation inspite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good faith, \nthe child's benefit. A has committed no offence.  \n(d) A is in a house w hich is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A \ndrops the child from the housetop, knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, \nbut not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child’s benefit. Here \neven if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence.  \nExplanation.__ Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and \n92. \n93. Communication made in good faith.  No communication made in good faith is an \noffence b y reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that \nperson.  \nIllustration  \nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The \npatient dies in consequence of the shock. A has co mmitted no offence, though he knew it to be likely \nthat the communication might cause the patient’s death.  \n94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.  Except murder, and offences against \nthe State punishable with death, nothing is an offence which i s done by a person who is compelled to \ndo it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to \nthat person will otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own \naccord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in \nthe situation by which he became subject to such constraint.  \nExplanation 1.__ A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, \njoins  a gang  of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the \nground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law.  \n \nPage 49 of 179 \n Explanation 2.__ A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced  by threat of instant death, to  \ndo a thing which is an offence by law ; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force \nthe door of a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception.  \n95. Act causing  slight harm.  Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is \nintended to cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no \nperson of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.  \nOf the Ri ght of Private Defence  \n96. Things done in private defence.  Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise \nof the right of private defence.  \n97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.  Every person has a right, \nsubject to the restrictions contained in section 99, to defend__ \nFirst.__ His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the \nhuman body ;  \nSecondly .__ The property, whether moveable or immoveable, of himself or of any other person,  \nagainst any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal \ntrespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.  \n98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.  When  an \nact, which would otherwise be a certain offence is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of \nmaturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or \nby reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private \ndefence against that act which he would have if the act were that offence.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A ; Z is guilty of no offence. But A \nhas the same right of private defence which he would have if Z were sane.  \n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking  \nA for a house­breaker, attacks A. Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception, \ncommits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which he \nwould have if Z were not acting under that misconception.  \n99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.  There is no right of private \ndefence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, \nif done, or attempted to be done by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, \nthough that act may not be strictly justifiable by law.  \nThere is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the \napprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, b y the direction of a public \nservant acting in good faith under colour of his office though that direction may not be strictly \njustifiable by law.  \nThere is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the \nprotection of the  public authorities.  \n  \n \nPage 50 of 179 \n Extent to which the right may be exercised. The right of private defence in no case extends \nto the inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.  \nExplanation 1.__ A person is not deprived of the r ight of private defence against an act done, or  \nattempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that the \nperson doing the act is such public servant.  \nExplanation 2.__ A person is not deprived of the right of p rivate defence against an act done, or  \nattempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, \nthat the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under \nwhich he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded.  \n100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.  The right \nof private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in t he last preceding section, \nto the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions \nthe exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:__ \nFirst .— Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will otherwise \nbe the consequence of such assault ;  \nSecondly .— Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will \notherwise be the consequence of such assaul t ; \nThirdly .— An assault with the intention of committing rape ;  \nFourthly .— An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust ;  \nFifthly .__ An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting ;  \nSixthly .__ An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances  \nwhich may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public \nauthorities for his release.  \n101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.  If the offence be \nnot of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of \nthe body does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the \nrestri ctions mentioned in section 99 to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than \ndeath.  \n102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.  The \nright  of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonabl e apprehension of danger to the \nbody arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been \ncommitted ; and it continues as long as such, apprehension of danger to the body continues.  \n103. When the right of private defe nce of property extends to causing death.  The right \nof private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary \ncausing of death or of any other harm to the wrong­doer, if the offence, the committing of which, o r \nthe attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the des­ \ncriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely : — \n  \n \nPage 51 of 179 \n First .—  Robbery ;  \nSecondly .—  House­breaking by night ;  \nThirdly .—  Mischief by fire committed on any buil ding, tent or vessel, which building, tent \nor vessel is used as a human dwelling or as a place for the custody of property ;  \nFourthly .—  Theft, mischief or house­trespass , under such circumstances as may reasonably \ncause apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence \nis not exercised.  \n104. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.  If the offence, the \ncommitting of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right of private \ndefence, be theft, mischief, or criminal trespass, not of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last \npreceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject \nto the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrong­doer of any harm \nother than death.  \n105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.  The \nright of private defence of property commences when a reasonable apprehension of danger to the \nproperty commences.  \nThe right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his \nretreat with the property or either the  assistance of the public authorities is obtained, or the property \nhas been recovered.  \nThe right of private defence of properly against robbery continues as long as the offender \ncauses or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of \ninstant death or of instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues.  \nThe right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long \nas the offender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief.  \nThe right of private defence of property against house­breaking by night continues as long as \nthe house­trespass which has been begun by such house­breaking continues.  \n106. Right of private defence against deadly assault when there is  risk of harm to \ninnocent person.  If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably \ncauses the apprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that \nright without risk of harm to an  innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of \nthat risk.  \nIllustration  \nA is attached by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of \nprivate defence  without firing on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children \nwho are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if by so firing he harms any of the children.  \n \n \n \nPage 52 of 179 \n CHAPTER V  \nOF ABETMENT  \n107. Abetment of a thing.  A person abets the doing of a thing, who —  \nFirst .— Instigates any person to do that thing ; or,  \nSecondly .__ Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the \ndoing of  that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursua nce of that conspiracy, and in \norder to the doing of that thing ; or  \nThirdly .__ Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.  \nExplanation 1 .__ A person who, by willful misrepresentation, or by willful concealment of a  \nmateria l fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or \nprocure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.  \nIllustration  \nA, a public officer, is authorized by a warrant from a Court of Justice to  apprehend Z. B, \nknowing that fact and also that C is not Z, willfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally \ncauses A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C.  \nExplanation 2. __ Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does \nanything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission \nthereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.  \n108. Abettor.  A person abets an off ence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or \nthe commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of \ncommitting an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.  \nExplanation 1.__ The a betment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence \nalthough the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.  \nExplanation 2 . To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted  \nshould be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit \nmurder.  \n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers  from \nthe wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder.  \nExplanation  3 .__ It  is  not  necessary  that  the  person  abetted  should  be  capable  by  law  \nof committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the \nabettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.  \n  \n \nPage 53 of 179 \n Illustrations  \n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be \nan offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and \nhaving t he same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty \nof abetting an offence.  \n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to \ndo an act which causes Z’s death. B, in consequence of the a betment, does the act in \nthe absence of A and thereby, causes Z’s death. Here, though B was not capable by law \nof committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had \nbeen capable by law of committing an offence, and had committ ed murder, and he is \ntherefore subject to the punishment of death.  \n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling­house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of \nhis mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is \nwrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A’s instigation. B has \ncommitted no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a \ndwelling­ house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence.  \n(d) A intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to \nZ out of Z’s possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes \nthe property out of Z’s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A’s proper ty. B, \nacting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not \ncommit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liab1e to the same punishment as \nif B had committed theft.  \nExplanation 4 .__ The abetment of an offence being a n offence, the abetment of such an \nabetment is also an offence.  \nIllustration  \nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C \ncommits that offence in consequence of B’s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his  offence with \nthe punishment for murder ; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same \npunishment.  \nExplanation 5 .__ It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy  \nthat the abettor should concert  the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages \nin the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.  \nIllustration  \nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then \nexplains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without \nmentioning A’s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose \nof its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison ; Z dies in consequence. Here, \nthough A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance \nof which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is \nliable to the punishm ent for murder.  \n \nPage 54 of 179 \n 1[108A. Abetment in Pakistan of offences outside it.  A person abets an offence within the \nmeaning of this Code who, in 2[Pakistan], abets the commission of any act without and beyond \n2[Pakistan] which would constitute an offence committed in 2[Pakistan].  \nIllustration  \nA, in 2[Pakistan], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa. A is guilty of \nabetting murder.]  \n109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed  in consequence and where \nno express provision is made for its punishment.  Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted \nis committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the \npunishment of such abetment, b e punished with the punishment provided for the offence  3[:] \n4[Provided that, except in case of Ikrah­i­Tam  (اکراہ تام) , the abettor of an offence referred to in \nChapter XVI shall be liable to punishment of ta’zir  specified for such offence including death.].  \nExplanation .__ An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it \nis committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which \nconstitutes  the abetment.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the \nexercise of B’s official functions. B accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined \nin section 161.  \n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation commits that \noffence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.  \n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison \nand deliver s it to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the \nconspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A's absence and thereby causes Z’s death. \nHere B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is \nliable to the punishment for murder.  \n110. Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from \nthat of abettor.  Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act \nwith a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment \nprovided for the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention \nor knowledge of the abettor and with no other.  \n111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.  When an act is \nabetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manne r and to the \nsame extent as if he had directly abetted it:  \n \n1This Section was added by the Indian Penal Code Amdt. Act, 1898 (4 of 1898), s. 3.  \n2Subs. by the Central Laws (Statute Reform) Ordinance, 1960 (21 of 1960),s. 3 and 2nd Sch. ( w.e.f.  14th October,  1955), for “the Provinces and the \nCapital of the Federation” which had been subs. by A.O., 1949, Arts. 3(2) and 4, for “British India”.  \n3Subs. by the criminal law (Amdt.), Act, 1997 (II of 1997), s. 6 for “full­stop”.  \n4Proviso added ibid. \n \n \n \nPage 55 of 179 \n Proviso.  Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was \ncommitted under the influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy \nwhich constituted the abetment.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A instigates a child to put poi son into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that \npurpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into \nthe food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here if the child was acting under the \ninfluence of A's instigati on, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable \nconsequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as \nif he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y.  \n(b) A instigates B to burn Z's house. B s ets fire to the house and at the same time commits \ntheft of property there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not \nguilty of abetting the theft ; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable \nconsequence of the burning.  \n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of \nrobbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, \nand being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the \nprobable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for \nmurder.  \n112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.  If \nthe act for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committe d in addition to the \nact abetted, and constitutes a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the \noffences.  \nIllustration  \nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists \nthat distress . In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the \ndistress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily \ncausing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences ; and, if A new that B was \nlikely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for \neach of the offences.  \n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that \nintended by the abettor.  When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing \na particular effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a \ndifferent effect from that intended by th e abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same \nmanner and to the same extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, \nprovided he knew that the act abetted was likely to cause that effect.  \nIllustration  \nA instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of the instigation, causes grievous \nhurt to Z. Z dies in consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause \ndeath. A is liable to be punished with the punishment provi ded for murder.  \n \nPage 56 of 179 \n 114. Abettor present when offence is committed.  Whenever any person, who if absent \nwould be liable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be \npunishable in consequence of the abetment is committed , he shall be deemed to have committed such \nact or offence.  \n115. Abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life if offence not \ncommitted ; Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or 1[imprisonment \nfor life], shal l, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express pro­ \nvision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of \neither description for a term which may extend to seven years, and sha ll also be liable to fine ;  \nif act causing harm be done in consequence. and if any act for which the abettor is liable in \nconsequence  of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable \nto imprisonment of either descr iption for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be \nliable to fine.  \nIllustration  \nA instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have \nbeen subject to the punishment of death 1[or imprisonment for life.]  Therefore  A is liable to \nimprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to a fine ; and, if any hurt be done \nto Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend \nto fourteen years, and to fine.  \n116. Abetment  of offence  punishable  with  imprisonment__ if offence  be not committed;   \nWhoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in \nconsequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of \nsuch abetment, be punished with imprisonment of any descriptio n provided for that offence for a term \nwhich may extend to one­fourth part of the longest term provided for that offence; or with such fine as \nis provided for that offence, or with both ;  \nif abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to  prevent offence.  and if \nthe abettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such \noffence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, \nfor a term which may e xtend to one­half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such \nfine as is provided for the offence, or with both.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the \nexercise of B’s officia l functions. B refuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under \nthis section.  \n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has \nnevertheless committed the offence defined in this section, and is punishable \naccordin gly. \n \n \n1Subs. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972),s.2 and Sch., for “transportation for life”.  \n \nPage 57 of 179 \n (c) A, a police­officer , whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of \nrobbery. Here, though the robbery be not committed, A is liable to one­half of the \nlongest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine.  \n(d) B abets the commission of a robb ery by A, a police­officer, whose duty it is to prevent \nthat offence. Here though the robbery be not committed, B is liable to one­half of the \nlongest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and also to fine.  \n117. Abetting commission of o ffence by the public or by more than ten persons.  \nWhoever abets the commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of \npersons exceeding ten, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may \nextend t o three years, or with fine, or with both.  \nIllustration  \nA affixes in a public place a placard instigating a sect consisting of more than ten members to \nmeet at a certain time and place, for the purpose of attacking the members of an adverse act, while \nenga ged in a procession. A has committed the offence defined in this section.  \n118. Concealing design to commit offence punishable with  death or imprisonment for \nlife. Whoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate th e \ncommission of an offence punishable with death or l[imprisonment for life],  \nif offence be committed;  voluntarily conceals, by any act or illegal omission, the existence of \na design to commit such offence or makes any representation which he knows to be false respecting \nsuch design,  \nif offence be not  committed . shall, if that offence be committed, be puni shed with \nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or, if the offence be \nnot committed, with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years ; \nand in either case shall also be liable to fi ne. \nIllustration  \nA, knowing that dacoity is about to be committed at B, falsely informs the Magistrate that a \ndacoity is about to be committed at C, a place in an opposite direction, and thereby misleads the \nMagistrate with intent to facilitate the commiss ion of the offence. The dacoity is committed at B in \npursuance of the design. A is punishable under this section.  \n119. Public servant concealing design to commit offence which it is his duty to prevent. \nWhoever , being a public servant intending to facilita te or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby \nfacilitate the commission of an offence which it is his duty as such public servant to prevent,  \nvoluntarily conceals, by any act or illegal omission, the existence of a design to commit such \noffence, or ma kes any representation which he knows to be false respecting such design,  \n \n \n \n1Subs. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972),s.2 and Sch., for “transportation for life”.  \n  \n \nPage 58 of 179 \n If offence be committed;  shall, if the offence be committed, be punished with imprisonment \nof any description provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to one­half of the longest \nterm of such imprisonment, or with such fine as is provided for that offence, or with bot h ; \nif offence be punishable with death, etc.;  or if the offence be punishable with death or \n1[imprisonment for life], with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten \nyears ;  \nif offence be not committed.  or, if the offence be not  committed, shall be punished with \nimprisonment of any description provided for the offence for a term which may extend to one­fourth \npart of the longest term of such imprisonment or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or with \nboth.  \nIllustration  \nA, an officer of police, being legally bound to give information of all designs to commit robbery \nwhich may come to his knowledge, and knowing that B designs to commit robbery, omits to give such \ninformation, with intent to facilitate the commission of th at offence. Here A has by an illegal omission \nconcealed the existence of B’s design, and is liable to punishment according to the provision of this \nsection.  \n120. Concealing design to commit offence punishable with imprisonment.  Whoever, \nintending to facili tate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of an \noffence punishable with imprisonment,  \nvoluntarily conceals, by any act or illegal omission, the existence of a design to commit such \noffence, or makes any representation w hich he knows to be false respecting such design,  \nif offence be committed ; if offence be not committed.  shall, if the offence be committed, be \npunished with imprisonment of the description provided for the offence, for a term which may extend \nto one­fourt h, and, if the offence be not committed, to one­eighth, of the longest term of such \nimprisonment, or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or with both.  \n2[CHAPTER VA  \nCRIMINAL CONSPIRACY  \n120A.

A has \ntherefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z’s \nconsent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it \nto be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A \nhas used criminal force to Z.  \n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z’s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken \ntheir pace. Here A has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the animals to \nchange their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has don e this \nwithout Z’s consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby \ninjure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z.  \n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the \npalanquin. Here A has cau sed cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by \nhis own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus \nintentionally, without Z’s consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A \nhas used criminal force to Z.  \n(d) A intenti onally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily \npower moved his own person so as to bring it into contact with Z.

Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of \ncausing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z’s clothes, A has used \nforce to Z; and if he  did so without Z’s consent, intending thereby to injure, \nfrighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.  \n(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, \nand if he does so without her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that \nhe may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her.  \n(g) Z is bathing, A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A \nintentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling  water \nas brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such \ncontact must affect Z’s sense of feeling: A has therefore intentionally used force \nto Z; and if he has done this without Z’s consent intending or knowing it to be \nlikely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used \ncriminal force.  \n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z’s consent. Here, if A intends to \ncause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z.  \n351. Assault.

A has committed an assault.  \n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending, or knowing it to be \nlikely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that he is about to cause the dog to \nattack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z.  \n(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I wi1l give you a beating”. Here, though the words \nused by A could in no case amount to an assault, and t hough the mere gesture, \nunaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault, the \ngesture explained by the words may amount to an assault.  \n352.

Theft.  Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any moveable property out of the \npossession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is \nsaid to commit theft.  \n \n1Subs. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s. 2 and Sch., for “transportation for life”.  \n2Subs. by the Criminal Laws (Amdt.) Ord.1980 (3 of 1980),s.6, for “may extend to”.  \n3Ins. by Act X of 2016, s. 7.  \n4Subs. by Act XXVII of 2018,s..3.  \n \n \nPage 136 of 179 \n Explanation 1.__ A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being moveable property, is \nnot the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed \nfrom the earth.  \nExplanation 2.__ A moving effected by the same act whic h effects the severance may be a theft.  \nExplanation 3.__ A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which  \nprevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.  \nExplanation 4.__ A person,  who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that  \nanimal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that \nanimal.  \nExplanation 5 .__ The consent mentioned in the definition may be expressed or implied, an d \nmay be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority \neither express or implied.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A cuts  down a tree on Z’s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the \ntree out of Z’s possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed \nthe tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.  \n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it. Here, \nif A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s \nconsent, A has committed theft as soon as Z’s dog has begun to follow A.  \n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain \ndirection, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the \nbullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.  \n(d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly \nruns a way with the plate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft.  \n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z \nshall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was \nnot in Z’s possession. I t could not therefore be taken out of Z’s possession and \nA has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of \ntrust.  \n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the \nring is in Z’s possession, and i f A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.  \n(g) A finds a ring lying on the high­road, not in the possession of any person. A, by \ntaking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation \nof property.  \n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lyi ng on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to \nmisappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides \nthe ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, \nwith the intention of taking the ring from the hid ing place and selling it when \nthe loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.  \n \nPage 137 of 179 \n (i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, \nnot owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jewe ller might lawfully detain \nthe watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of \nZ’s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal \ntrespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he di d was not \ndone dishonestly.  \n(j) If A owns money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully \nas a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the \nintention of depriving Z of the property as a security for h is debt, he commits \ntheft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.  \n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession without \nZ's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, be commits theft, \nthough the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.  \n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession with out Z’s consent, \nwith the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for \nits restoration. Here A takes dishonestly ; A has  therefore committed theft.  \n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes in to Z’s library in Z’s absence, and \ntakes away a book without Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of \nreading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable t han A may \nhave conceived that he had Z’s implied consent to use Z’s book. If this was A's \nimpression, A has not committed theft.  \n(n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A \nknows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is pro bable that A may conceive that \nZ’s wife is authorized to give away alms. If this was A’s impression, A has not \ncommitted theft.  \n(o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows \nto belong to her husband Z, and to be such prope rty as she has not authority \nfrom Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.  \n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes \nthat property out of B’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishones tly, he \ndoes not commit theft.  \n379. Punishment for theft.  Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of \neither description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine or with both.  \n380. Theft in dwelling house. etc.  Whoever commits theft in any building, tent or vessel, \nwhich building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or used for the custody of property shall be \npunished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, an d \nshall also be liable to fine.  \n381.

Theft of a car or other motor vehicles.__ Whoever commits theft of a car or any other \nmotor vehicle, including motor­cycle, scooter and Tractor shall be punished with imprisonment of \neither description for a term which may extend to seven years and with fine not exceeding the value of \nthe stolen car or motor vehicle.]  \n2[Explanation.__ Theft of an  electric motor of a tube well or  transformer  shall  be within the \nmeaning of this section.]  \n382. Theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the \ncommitting of the theft.  Whoever commits theft, having made preparation for causing death, or hurt, \nor restraint, or fear of death, or of hurt, or of restraint, to any person, in order to the committing of such \ntheft, or in order to the effecting of his escape after the committing  of such theft, or in order to the \nretaining of property taken by such theft, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term \nwhich may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A commits theft on property i n Z’s possession ; and, while committing this theft, \nhe has a loaded pistol under his garment having provided this pistol for the \npurpose of hurting Z in case Z should resist. A has committed the offence \ndefined in this section.  \n(b) A picks Z’s pocket, hav ing posted several of his companions near him in order \nthat they may restrain Z, if Z should perceive what is passing and should resist, \nor should attempt to apprehend A. A has committed the offence defined in this \nsection.  \n383. Extortion.  Whoever intentio nally puts any person in fear of any injury to that person, \nor to any other, and thereby dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any \nproperty or valuable security or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a val uable \nsecurity, commits “extortion”.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A threatens to publish a defamatory libel concerning Z unless Z gives him \nmoney. He thus induces Z to give him money. A has committed extortion.  \n(b) A threatens Z that he will keep Z’s child in wrongful confinement unless Z will \nsign and deliver to A a promissory note binding Z to pay certain money to A. Z \nsigns and delivers the note. A has committed extortion.  \n(c) A threatens to send club­men to ploug h up Z’s field unless Z will sign and \ndeliver to B a bond binding Z under a penalty to deliver certain produce to B, \nand thereby induces Z to sign and deliver the bond. A has committed extortion.  \n(d) A, by putting Z in fear of grievous hurt, dishonestly in duces Z to sign or affix \nhis seal to a blank paper and deliver it to A. Z signs and delivers the paper to A. \nHere, as the paper so signed may be converted into a valuable security, A has \ncommitted extortion.  \n \n1Ins. by Act I of 1996, s.2.  \n2Added by Act XVI of 1996, s.2.  \n \nPage 139 of 179 \n 384.

A, in order to defraud \nB, adds a cipher to the 10,000 and makes the sum 1,00,000, intending that it may \nbe believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.  \n(b) A, without Z’s authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a \nconveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B \nand thereby of obtaining from B the purchase­money. A has committed forgery.  \n(c) A picks up a che que on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any \nsum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by \ninserting the sum of ten thousand rupees.

B \nfraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thou sand rupees. \nB commits forgery.  \n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B’s authority, \nintending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up \nthe bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with int ent to deceive the \nbanker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to \ndiscount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.  \n(f) Z’s will contains these words­\"I direct that all my remaining property be equally \ndivided between A, B and C.\" A dishonestly scratches out B’s name, intending \nthat it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has \ncommitted forgery.  \n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his \norder by writing on the bill the words “ Pay to Z or his order” and signing the \nendorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order” and thereby \nconverts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.  \n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in or der to defraud Z of his \nestate executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier \nthan the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had \nconveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forger y. \n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the  \nlegatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will \naccording to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed \nforgery.  \n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B’s name without B's authority, certifying that \nA is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen \nmisfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other \npersons. Here, as A  made a false document in order to induce Z to part with \nproperty. A has committed forgery.  \n(k) A without B’s authority writes a letter and signs it in B’s name certifying to A’s \ncharacter, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed \nforgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and \nthereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service.  \nExplanation 1.__ A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A signs  his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed \nthat the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed \nforgery.  \n \nPage 164 of 179 \n (b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z’s name, in \norder that B may  afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B \nupon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty \nof forgery ; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant \nto A’s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.  \n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the \nsame name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be \nbelieved that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable, here \nA ha s committed forgery.  \n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B after the \nseizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate to Z at a \nnominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months pr ior to the \nseizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease \nwas granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, \ncommits forgery by antedating it.  \n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, l odges effects with B for A’s benefit, \nand with intent to defraud his creditors ; and in order to give a colour to the \ntransaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value \nreceived, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been \nmade before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under \nthe first head of the definition.  \nExplanation 2.__ The  making  of  a  false  document in the name of a fictitious person, intending \nit to be  believed that  the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, \nintending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his life time, may amount to \nforgery.  \nIllustration  \nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, an d fraudulently accepts the bill in the \nname of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it.
